AI agent tools make possible the creation of autonomous AI agents—software entities that can and act on their own and undertake some step-by-step tasks, like researching for a paper. The AI agent market, which is estimated at {{< external-link link="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-agents-market-report" >}}$5.4 billion{{< /external-link >}} in 2024, is being pushed by use cases such as self-service customer experiences, or even crypto trading agents.

And cloud computing has made AI agent deployment more accessible because it allows companies to scale their applications without heavy infrastructure costs. So if you are looking for tools to create your own AI agent, look no further.

## What are AI agent tools

AI agent tools are the solutions you can use to develop intelligent, autonomous systems that can interact with data, automate workflows, and make decisions. Most AI agents depend on a combination of libraries, frameworks, and deployment environments that allow them to process data, communicate with other systems, and execute complex operations.

## Useful AI agent tools for developers

Many open-source networks have sprung up to help out as agent-based AI frameworks gain recognition. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular AI agent tools available out there.

### LangChain

{{< external-link link="https://www.langchain.com/" >}}LangChain{{< /external-link >}} is a free and {{< external-link link="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain" >}}open-source{{< /external-link >}} AI agent tool that helps developers by connecting LLMs to external data, APIs, and workflows. LangChain lets you combine features like memory, APIs, and logic flows and allows AI agents to remember past interactions. It’s a building block for a more complex AI agent like a research assistant.

But developers are also questioning how much they really need LangChain to run AI agents. Some are claiming that they can get far enough with {{< external-link link="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk" >}}LangSmith{{< /external-link >}}, which, for example, is not free. Developers who argue for it say LangChain is actually good for chaining actions and workflows, especially since you can figure out their wrapper patterns. Others say it works well for a standard use case, but if you need something a little different, you have to go through plenty of layers of abstraction just to change a small detail. Also, these layers of abstraction mean you won't understand every step in the process, so if there is a problem, you will start from scratch.

So if you’re looking for the ideal AI agent tool, you should maybe check other entries before opting for LangChain. Or, as plenty of developers recommend, you could get straight into LangSmith or other modules. You can also jump straight to a tutorial and learn {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/data-analyst-agent-langgraph-genezio/#introduction" >}}how to deploy an AI agent with LangGraph{{< /external-link >}}, a LangChain module.

### Mirascope

{{< external-link link="https://mirascope.com/" >}}Mirascope{{< /external-link >}} is the true open-source alternative to LangChain. It turns out that LangChain (and you can tell this from their landing page) has allegedly become “commercial” (that’s speculation) and some related tools are now paid for (that’s {{< external-link link="https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith" >}}a fact{{< /external-link >}}). Keep in mind that LangChain proper is free and open-source, but when IBM and AWS have websites about it, it ought to mean it could stop being freeware one day. That’s why Mirascope is an attractive alternative for developers looking out for an AI agent tool that’s run by a smaller team. Some developers also claim that Mirascope is significantly less complex than LangChain.

### Mastra

{{< external-link link="https://mastra.ai/" >}}Mastra{{< /external-link >}}, a TypeScript AI framework, is a new kid on the block. Their words (not ours): “If you hate Langchain, you'll love Mastra.” Known for creating Gatsby, a React framework, they now created Mastra to help with challenges in creating AI agents like debugging prompts. Mastra went viral and stars jumped from 1.5k to 7.5k. Use cases they claim some YC companies are tapping into Mastra for include agent workflows, automation in support, or medical transcriptions. Some of its features are workflow graphs with suspend/resume, RAG pipelines, evals, multi-agent, testing, and a {{< external-link link="https://x.com/calcsam" >}}very online{{< /external-link >}} founder. It {{< external-link link="https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra" >}}supports{{< /external-link >}} GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and any LLM.

### AutoGen Studio

{{< external-link link="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/" >}}AutoGen{{< /external-link >}} is a low-code AI agent tool that lets AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. Unlike standalone AI models or browser-based LLMs, AutoGen enables multiple agents to interact, refine their outputs, and optimize problem-solving strategies. With multi-agent coordination, AutoGen is great for coding or data analysis. It supports top LLMs like GPT-4 (Microsoft financed OpenAI and injected millions of dollars).

### CrewAI

{{< external-link link="https://www.crewai.com/" >}}CrewAI{{< /external-link >}} is an AI agent tool designed for managing and coordinating multiple AI agents on complex tasks. It lets developers assign roles, define workflows, and enable agent collaboration. This makes it particularly useful for multistep processes like content generation, automated analysis, and decision-making. The way they market it, it’s almost like a one-stop-shop SaaS: They really claim you can do anything with it. You can have an LLM, you can hire an employee, you can run your finances by it… and so much more. Of course, it’s up for debate if it actually does an average job with all of these micro-SaaS ideas.

### DeployApps

This entry is a bit different. It’s an AI agent tool because it’s one of the best ways to run yours.

Well, building an AI agent is only one part of the battle, because deploying it and operating it is just as important. As your AI projects grow, performance constraints like cost, speed, and concurrency—along with security concerns—could make you lose your sleep (or leave you paying a huge invoice). That’s why you need to carefully choose a platform that will let you deploy an AI agent in an affordable environment. That’s where {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/" >}}DeployApps{{< /external-link >}} comes in.

DeployApps is a serverless cloud platform that provides all the infrastructure needed to deploy and run AI agents at scale. You only pay for the compute if your agent requires it, which means you won’t over- or underprovision. The serverless cloud hosting is specially useful for event-driven agents or agents with intermittent workloads, since the platform automatically scales your app. And DeployApps also allows you to import your projects from {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/import-github-projects-genezio/" >}}GitHub{{< /external-link >}} and automate your deployment.

## Deploy your AI Agents with DeployApps

If you need a cost-effective, scalable, and reliable way to deploy your AI agents, DeployApps has you covered. You can connect your GitHub repository in an instant and deploy just as fast. DeployApps automatically detects your framework and handles deployment, scaling, and cloud ops—so you don’t have to.

DeployApps is an affordable AI agent tool that supports AI-driven applications with minimal setup and keeps them running consistently, even under high demand. Plus, with transparent pricing and a free Hobby tier, it’s a hassle-free way to experiment with serverless hosting for your AI agent.
