We’re thrilled to announce that {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/" >}}DeployApps{{< /external-link >}} now fully supports deploying Python popular frameworks like **Django**, **Flask**, **FastAPI**. With built-in **WSGI** and **ASGI** compatibility, DeployApps makes it effortless to develop Python applications across a variety of use cases, from web apps to real-time APIs and serverless solutions.

DeployApps is an easy-to-use, autoscalable, performance-oriented Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform designed to simplify cloud application development and deployment. By seamlessly managing scaling, performance optimization, and infrastructure overhead, DeployApps empowers developers to focus on building features and delivering value.

Whether you’re developing scalable web applications, high-performance APIs, or serverless solutions, DeployApps provides a streamlined, efficient environment to bring your ideas to production faster than ever before.

**Get started** {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=faas-python-getting-started" >}}right now{{< /external-link >}} or learn more about the platform below.

## Why choose DeployApps for Serverless Python development?

## Out-of-the-Box Framework Detection and Deployment

Deploying Python applications often involves configuring compatibility with either WSGI or ASGI protocols, based on the framework being used.

DeployApps simplifies this process by automatically detecting your application's requirements and configuring the deployment environment accordingly:

- Traditional Frameworks: Seamless support for Django, Flask, FastAPI and similar WSGI-based frameworks for stable and synchronous operations.

- Modern Frameworks: Optimized for FastAPI and other ASGI-based frameworks, ensuring high-performance asynchronous processing.

This automation allows developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about protocol mismatches or manual configurations.

## Enhanced Developer Experience

DeployApps transforms Python deployment into an intuitive and efficient process, thanks to features such as:

- **One-Click Deployments** for {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=django-getting-started" >}}Django{{< /external-link >}}, {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=flask-getting-started" >}}Flask{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=fastapi-getting-started" >}}FastAPI{{< /external-link >}} applications.

- **GitHub Integration**, connect your GitHub repository, push your code, and let DeployApps handle the rest.

With DeployApps, you can focus on building features and solving problems instead of managing infrastructure, saving you **time and effort** during development.

## Optimized Cold Starts and Serverless Apps

DeployApps’s Python runtime is optimized for efficiency, enabling you to run your applications with minimal resource usage while maintaining top-tier performance.

By combining reduced cold start delays with robust **support for parallel calls**, DeployApps offers the perfect platform for latency-sensitive applications like: {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=flask-chatgpt-getting-started" >}}Real-time chat services{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=flask-getting-started" >}}Streaming APIs{{< /external-link >}}.

## Seamless Autoscalability

DeployApps offers seamless autoscaling, ensuring your applications can handle spikes in demand while maintaining optimal performance. Whether your app sees sudden surges or fluctuating workloads, DeployApps's autoscaling capabilities keep your applications running smoothly, so you can focus on building features rather than worrying about infrastructure.

## DeployApps vs. Competitors

When comparing DeployApps to competitors like **AWS Lambda**, **Heroku**, or **Google Cloud**, it stands out with a focus on **developer-centric simplicity** and **performance optimization**:

- **Simpler Deployment**: DeployApps's one-click deployment process and built-in guides eliminate the steep learning curve often associated with cloud platforms.

- **Reduced Cold Start Times**: DeployApps outperforms competitors by minimizing serverless cold starts by up to 4x, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications.

- **Dual Compatibility**: Unlike platforms that favor either WSGI or ASGI, DeployApps provides robust support for both, catering to all Python frameworks.

- **Lower Overhead**: With built-in FaaS integration and lightweight infrastructure management, DeployApps offers more streamlined development workflows, especially for serverless applications.

These advantages make DeployApps the preferred choice for Python developers seeking **speed**, **flexibility**, and **ease of use** without compromising on scalability.
