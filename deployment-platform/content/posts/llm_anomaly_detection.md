Large language models (LLMs) don't always behave the way you expect. They can go off-topic, return inaccurate data, or overlook important instructions. Genezio's focus on LLM anomaly detection helps businesses test and monitor AI agents and catch (and address!) those harmful behaviors before they happen with clients.

## What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

LLMs are AI systems trained on large amounts of data. They can write content, answer questions, summarize documents, power chatbots, and more. Many businesses use them in customer service, banking, and healthcare. While they're useful for handling tasks at scale, they can also make mistakes. Regular testing helps detect (and address) these issues before they spread.

## What is LLM anomaly detection?

LLM anomaly detection is the process of identifying and managing unusual or unwanted behavior in AI-generated responses. These could be false facts, off-topic replies, missing details, or broken policies. Genezio tests AI agents to catch these problems in time, so teams can adjust before they affect real customers.

## How to Detect and Manage LLM Anomalies with Genezio

Customer Care Executives and IT leads usually know which AI agents need testing. Genezio makes it easy to test LLMs and get actionable results in three steps.

**Define**: Select the AI agents to test and set clear standards.

Start with the agents that handle customer interactions. Genezio builds a Knowledge Base using your internal documents, URLs, and written content. This keeps responses grounded in the right information. You can also set your own limits for accuracy and compliance.

**Simulate**: Run tests that mimic real customer conversations.

Use Genezio to simulate interactions in multiple languages and run several tests at once. You can add pre-trained validation agents to check the responses. These simulations help uncover issues like false information, missed rules, or off-topic replies.

**Monitor**: Track AI performance and spot problem areas.

Genezio gives you reports that break down how your AI is doing over time. You'll see accuracy scores, flagged responses, and possible policy violations. You can run these reports once or keep them going over time to catch recurring issues.

## Types of LLM Anomalies and Why They Happen

LLMs can fail for different reasons. Knowing the common causes helps make detection more accurate.

- **False or outdated answers**: AI might return information that no longer applies or was never true to begin with. This is often a result of hallucination or limitations in the LLM's training data.
- **Off-topic replies**: AI responses can shift away from the customer's question. This usually points to a failure in intent recognition or relevance.
- **Inappropriate content**: AI might use biased or problematic wording. This is linked to bias, tone issues, or toxic language in the model.
- **Data leaks**: AI can mention internal information or sensitive data and put the business' security at risk. This happens when the model memorizes and repeats private or restricted information.
- **Cost issues**: Long or inefficient responses can increase your API costs. This shows performance glitches that affect resource usage and pricing.

## How Genezio Handles LLM Anomalies

Genezio runs automated checks to detect common anomalies in LLM responses before they reach production. Here's what it looks for:

- **Fact-checking**: Compares AI output against reliable sources to catch wrong or outdated information.
- **Relevance filters**: Helps flag answers that drift off-topic or miss the point of the original question.
- **Tone and safety checks**: Scans for biased, toxic, or inappropriate language to protect your brand reputation.
- **Data exposure alerts**: Detects when AI mentions sensitive or private data that shouldn't be shared.
- **Token tracking**: Watches response length and resource use to help control API costs.

## Why Choose Genezio for LLM Anomaly Detection?

Even when LLMs get it wrong, they can sound like they know what they're doing. Instead of guessing where your AI might go wrong, Genezio helps you validate it with tools built for real-world performance.

Here's why Genezio is different:
- **Regular testing**: It spots issues over time, not just once.
- **Fast issue detection**: It flags problems before they reach customers.
- **Real-world simulations**: It tests how AI behaves in practical scenarios.
- **Detailed reports**: It detects where responses miss the mark and shows how to fix them.
- **Industry-ready**: It's built for teams in retail, banking, healthcare, and more.
- **Scalable monitoring**: It scales easily for small support teams or large enterprise systems.

## Tools That Complement LLM Anomaly Detection

Some businesses add extra tools to support regular testing.

- **Automated Quality Management**: Checks if AI agents follow business rules and give accurate, reliable responses.
- **CX Automation**: Uses AI to speed up customer support and keep conversations accurate and consistent.
- **LLM Hallucination Detection**: Catches false or made-up responses before they reach customers.

## What Real AI Mistakes Look Like in Practice

AI can sound confident even when it's wrong. Without testing, mistakes can cost businesses money, trust, and customers. 

- **NYC Business Bot**: Advised users to break the law with incorrect permit information
- **OpenAI Whisper**: In hospital tests, the OpenAI Whisper transcription model made up entire sentences that were never spoken by patients or doctors.
- **Chevrolet**: AI system was manipulated into confirming a car purchase for one dollar, which damaged the dealership's reputation.

These AI failures all started with unchecked anomalies. {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/#cta-buttons" >}}Test now{{< /external-link >}}
