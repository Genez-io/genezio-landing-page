## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are software systems that make decisions and respond to input without human help. Businesses are using them in customer service to handle inquiries, provide support, and automate communications. Still, AI agents can be unreliable and generate plausible responses that are actually wrong. That's why regular testing is important.

## Common Challenges in AI Agent Deployment

In customer support, even one bad response can lead to lost trust, regulatory risk, or unnecessary costs.

- **Inaccurate information**: AI agents might pull outdated or wrong answers, which can damage credibility or create a liability.
- **Irrelevant responses**: If the agent doesn't stay on topic or mentions competitors, it can hurt customer trust and end the conversation.
- **Security leaks**: Without proper checks, AI agents might share internal prompts, system configurations, or sensitive customer data.
- **Inappropriate content**: AI agents can generate responses that sound rude, harmful, or simply off-tone.
- **Excessive cost**: Long or repetitive answers can use more tokens than necessary, which means higher bills and wasted resources.
- **Inconsistent behavior**: AI agents may respond well in one case but fail in others.
- **Lack of customization**: Without the ability to test against your own data and conversations, it's hard to know if the agent actually fits your company's standards.

## How to Test AI Agents Using Genezio

If you're a Customer Care Executive, you need to know how your AI agents respond in real scenarios. Genezio makes it easy to test AI agents through a simple three-step process you can repeat as often as needed.

### Define: Choose the AI agents that support your customers.

Select the AI agents that handle chats, support tickets, or automated replies. Genezio relies on a Knowledge Base from your files, text, or URLs, so the agents can pull answers from credible information. You can set your own accuracy rules and validation parameters.

### Simulate: Run realistic customer conversations.

Use Genezio to test how your AI agents interact with simulated customers. You can adjust the setup: change languages, number of parallel chats, or bring in validation agents. These tests help you see if the AI stays on track or drifts into wrong or off-topic answers.

### Monitor: Track AI performance and spot what needs fixing.

Genezio offers you detailed reports that show how the AI performs over time. Each report breaks down accuracy metrics, missed responses, and infractions to the set policy. You can choose one-time audits or ongoing monitoring.

## Main Features of Genezio's AI Agent Testing

As a Customer Care Executive, you're responsible for how AI agents handle real customer interactions. Genezio gives you the tools to test responses, catch hallucinations, and make sure your agents stay accurate, safe, and on-topic. Here's what the platform offers:

- **Fact-checking**: Checks AI-generated answers against your own knowledge base or other reliable sources, so customers get the right information every time.

- **Offensive language detection**: Catches inappropriate, harmful, or tone-deaf replies that could damage your customer experience.

- **Off-topic prevention**: Blocks irrelevant answers, competitor mentions, or other distractions that pull the conversation off track.

- **Cost monitoring**: Spots when AI is using too many tokens due to overly long or inefficient prompts, and keep expenses in check.

## Why Choose Genezio for AI Agent Testing?

Genezio gives you a simple way to see how your AI agents perform and spot what needs to be adjusted. It's especially useful if you're working in industries where small mistakes can lead to bigger problems.

With Genezio's tester, you can:
- Run realistic simulations to test AI behavior
- Set your own standards based on your industry field

## What Can Go Wrong Without AI Testing

Even well-built AI agents can slip up when left unchecked. These real-world examples of AI failures show how small errors can turn into bigger problems when there's no proper testing in place:

### Chevrolet
AI system was manipulated into confirming a car purchase for one dollar.

### Air Canada
The flag carrier was fined for chatbot misinformation about refund policies.

### Microsoft Copilot
The chatbot (formerly Bing Chat) showed anger and refused to continue a conversation when a user repeated questions and challenged its answers.
