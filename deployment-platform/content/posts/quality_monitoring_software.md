AI agents are becoming part of daily life in customer support. They can answer questions, handle simple requests, and take care of routine tasks. According to a 2024 study by Metrigy, {{< external-link link="https://metrigy.com/putting-the-core-in-place-for-ai-excellence/" >}}nearly half of companies{{< /external-link >}} already use AI in customer service, and another 38% plan to start within the year.

With more and more companies using AI in customer support, it becomes important to check how these agents are working. Quality monitoring software helps teams and Customer Care Experts review AI conversations to make sure replies are accurate, follow the rules, and reflect what the company would normally say. Without this kind of testing, AI agents can give out wrong or confusing information. That can frustrate customers and even cause problems with compliance.

In this article, we'll look at how quality monitoring software, like Genezio, helps businesses keep their AI agents on the right track, and make sure they benefit both customers and support teams.

## What is quality monitoring software?

Quality monitoring software is a tool designed to track and test the performance of customer service systems, like call centers or AI agents, across different interactions with clients. If considered from an AI agent standpoint, It looks at AI's accuracy, compliance with business regulations, and overall effectiveness. In the context of customer support, this means checking if the agent gives helpful answers, responds in a natural tone, and sticks to any legal or policy requirements.

Let's say a customer is asking about a refund. The agent needs to understand the request, explain the process correctly, and avoid saying anything misleading. If the agent misunderstands or makes something up, that's a problem. It could make the customer doubt the business or choose not to come back. Quality monitoring software helps catch those issues early and gives Customer Care teams a way to fix them.

AI agents should respond in ways that benefit both the customer and the support team. Quality monitoring software routinely keeps an eye on those interactions to make sure the agent meets expectations on both sides.

## Why quality monitoring matters for AI agents

AI agents are now widely used across industries—from handling refunds to answering sensitive healthcare or banking questions. While they can speed up support and take pressure off human teams, they can still get things wrong. Even the most advanced setups have made serious mistakes.

Take Air Canada, for example. Back in 2022, their chatbot gave a passenger {{< external-link link="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/02/19/what-air-canada-lost-in-remarkable-lying-ai-chatbot-case/" >}}incorrect information{{< /external-link >}} about a refund policy. When the customer followed the bot's advice and later asked the airline to reward it, the case went to court. The judge ruled that Air Canada was responsible for the chatbot's statements—and the airline had to pay. This was more than a technical fail for Air Canada. It cost money, harmed the brand, and pointed to a bigger issue: AI needs monitoring.

The best way to keep AI agents on track is with regular testing and reviews. Quality monitoring software watches the agent in action and spots problems before they get out of hand. It might spot a pattern of inaccurate replies, pick up on tone issues, or alert Customer Care teams when the agent starts giving answers it shouldn't.

Imagine a healthcare chatbot that starts suggesting treatments without approval. Or a banking bot that shares private account details because it misunderstood a prompt. These are real risks that show up when there's no clear system keeping watch. A strong quality monitoring software, like the Genezio platform, helps avoid this.

## How Genezio's quality monitoring software works

Genezio's solution is built to test and monitor agents to make sure they work as expected throughout their entire lifecycle. Now, how does it do that?

Before an AI agent responds to a customer, Genezio runs it through realistic test conversations. These include repeated prompts, misleading questions, and tricky cases that usually make the AI fail. This helps catch weak spots early, such as an agent using the wrong tone, giving unclear answers, or offering a refund when it shouldn't.

Once the agent is live, Genezio continues to track what it says. The system flags replies that seem off-topic, confusing, or risky. If the agent starts giving inconsistent answers or misreads specific types of requests, Genezio provides detailed reports that show where the problem started with clear examples and logs. This gives Customer Care Experts simple tools to work with, without the need for complex setup or deep technical skills.

Genezio's focus is on helping the agent improve long after deployment. Its intuitive quality monitoring software helps teams catch small problems before they turn into real support issues. Over time, this reduces support risks and helps the AI agent stay reliable—no matter how policies or customer behavior shift. That's how the agent continues to support both the customer and the team.

### Real-time monitoring and compliance checks

The biggest risks often come after the agent is live. Real customers bring real situations, and one wrong reply can do real damage.

That's why one of Genezio's standout features is live monitoring. If the agent says something it shouldn't—like skipping a verification step or exposing personal information—the system flags it immediately as it happens. In this way, Customer Support teams can respond quickly, before it becomes a complaint or leads to a policy violation.

This is especially important in sectors where mistakes carry real weight. In banking or healthcare, one wrong response could lead to a compliance fine or a privacy breach. Genezio helps catch those problems early. If the agent discloses private data or gives medical advice without proper context, the system spots it, so teams can fix it right away.

## Start monitoring your AI agent with Genezio today

As AI agents take on more of the support workload, quality monitoring becomes part of the everyday job. With the right setup, Customer Care Experts can rely on their agents to handle routine questions with clarity and consistency. That means customers get answers that match company policies, and support teams can spend their time on more complex or sensitive requests instead of double-checking every response.

In industries like banking, healthcare, or travel, where trust is hard to earn and easy to lose, that shift matters. One wrong reply can affect a customer's decision or lead to a compliance issue. A strong monitoring system like Genezio's tracks what agents are saying, flags risky responses, and gives teams a way to fix them quickly. That keeps conversations accurate and aligned with company standards.

Quality monitoring also helps teams adjust as support needs change. Customer questions are getting more specific, and support now happens across more platforms. That makes it harder to keep replies consistent. Genezio helps you review how agents are handling different types of requests, spot unclear or incomplete replies, and follow up with targeted updates. Over time, that means fewer repeat issues, more confident support teams, and a better experience on both ends.
