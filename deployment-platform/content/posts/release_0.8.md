We're super excited to share that DeployApps v0.8 is here. Our latest update is all about making your life easier, whether you're building the next big thing or just playing around with new tech. Let's take a look at what’s new.

## Plug-and-Play User Authentication Module

Ever found yourself tangled in the web of authentication logic? We did, and it wasn't fun. So, we've introduced a plug-and-play user auth system. You can easily add login to your app, making sure it's safe, quick, and easy for users to use.

Our authentication solution offers you the flexibility to choose between Postgres and Mongo databases for storing user data and access tokens.

Learn more about how to integrate this into your project in our {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/docs/features/authentication" >}}tutorial{{< /external-link >}}.

## PostgreSQL Databases Right Here

Managing your PostgreSQL databases is now simpler with DeployApps. No more switching between platforms. Everything you need is right on your DeployApps {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/databases" >}}Dashboard{{< /external-link >}}.

DeployApps provides databases on demand, set up quickly via our partners. This way, you can get your database up and running fast, without stressing over infrastructure, scaling, or maintenance.

Follow our step-by-step {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/docs/features/databases#how-to-create-a-database" >}}instructions{{< /external-link >}} to create and use a database.

## Golang Support in Beta

And for the Go fans out there, we've got some good news. DeployApps now has beta support for Golang. That means you can start using all our cool features with Go, trying out new things and building faster, more reliable apps. It's still in beta, but we're eager to see what you'll create.

Golang support has been temporarily suspended. However, you can explore examples for other {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/docs/examples/" >}}supported languages here{{< /external-link >}}.

## Enhanced Developer Documentation in SDKs

We’ve made things simpler for you by automatically migrating the documentation comments you include in a DeployApps class to the corresponding classes and methods in the generated SDK.
Simply hover over the SDK methods in your IDE to instantly check the method’s purpose, parameters and types, making your coding experience smoother and more intuitive.
