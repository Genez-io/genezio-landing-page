# AI Third-Party Testing: Why Independent Testing Matters for AI Agents

According to Anthropic, one of the biggest challenges in AI today is the need for independent testing. As the Anthropic team explained in a {{< external-link link="<https://www.anthropic.com/news/third-party-testing>" >}}2024 write-up{{< /external-link >}}, AI agents are being deployed in high-stakes environments. For example, they handle customer service, process financial transactions, and even assist in medical diagnoses. Still, many businesses deploy them without proper testing, which opens the door to potential financial losses, legal issues, and damage to their reputation.

As businesses continue to increase their AI investments, the need for independent testing becomes even clearer. A recent McKinsey report shows that {{< external-link link="<https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work>" >}}92% of companies{{< /external-link >}} plan to invest more in generative AI over the next three years. Yet, at the same time, businesses are facing a huge challenge in AI adoption: limited in-house expertise. IBM's Global AI Adoption Index found that {{< external-link link="<https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9240059-ibm-2023-global-ai-adoption-index-report/>" >}}33% of companies{{< /external-link >}} identify a lack of AI skills as a major barrier to success.

This gap in AI knowledge highlights the importance of independent testing. AI third-party testing helps businesses make sure that their AI agents work as expected. Some governments may eventually require AI testing, but businesses can't afford to wait. So, **testing AI agents is already a necessity**.

In this article, we\'ll explore why AI third-party testing matters for AI safety and reliability, and explain how {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/>" >}}Genezio, a platform to test AI agents{{< /external-link >}}, can make this process simple and effective for businesses of all sizes.

## What are AI agents?

AI agents are software programs that perform tasks humans used to do. Businesses use them to assist customers, process data, and automate workflows. Some {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/blog/understanding-ai-agents-101/>" >}}AI agents{{< /external-link >}} answer customer questions in natural-sounding language, while others generate reports or help with financial decisions. But AI agents, like LLMs, don't always get things right, which is why they need testing before they're put to work.

## What is AI third-party testing?

AI third-party testing is the process of checking AI systems to make sure they work as expected. It checks that AI agents provide accurate, reliable responses and comply with industry rules. AI can generate answers that sound right but may be completely wrong, which can lead to serious mistakes if left unchecked. That's why independent testing is so important --- it helps prevent costly failures before they happen.

For example, an AI-powered banking assistant must give correct financial advice while following regulations. If the system produces misleading guidance, customers could lose money, and the bank could face lawsuits. The same risk applies to AI-driven customer support in different sectors, such as healthcare. If an AI misinterprets symptoms and gives dangerous advice, it could put patients at risk and expose the company to legal trouble.

But there's also a risk that neither agent was predetermined to be a banking or healthcare expert, but it still *acts as one*. Since AI agents based on LLMs are trained on a trove of information, these agents are particularly prone to start "talking" far and beyond their area of programming. So, a bank with a support chatbot might instruct the AI agent to never, ever provide financial advice. But real-world cases have shown how these AI agents can be easily jailbroken into, well, handing out financial advice. And users might even force them to do so to hold the company liable. It can go even further than that. Some AI agents have even been called out for manipulating the emotions of teenagers.

With Genezio, businesses can avoid these risks. Genezio tests AI agents before deployment and keeps monitoring them while live. This way, companies can catch errors early and prevent sudden failures. Thanks to an environment where it simulates real-world case scenario, Genezio helps businesses make sure their AI agents respond correctly, follow business rules, and don't turn into liabilities.

## Why AI third-party testing matters

Anthropic outlines {{< external-link link="<https://www.anthropic.com/news/third-party-testing>" >}}multiple risks{{< /external-link >}} tied to AI, such as misinformation, election fraud, and security threats. While these issues affect society at large, businesses face more immediate concerns. AI-generated misinformation can create legal problems, inaccurate financial advice can cause big losses, and AI-powered customer service can backfire if not properly tested.

AI failures happen all the time, and here's one you might remember: Chevrolet's chatbot agreed to sell a 2024 Chevy Tahoe {{< external-link link="<https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1736533308849443121>" >}}for one dollar{{< /external-link >}}. This mistake went viral, and seriously damaged the dealership's reputation. Proper AI independent testing could've saved them from this legally-binding headache.

Another case involved the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). The organization replaced human helpline staff with an AI agent called Tessa. The bot was supposed to give safe advice, but instead, it recommended {{< external-link link="<https://www.instagram.com/heysharonmaxwell/p/Cs1jp1pPkOs/?img_index=3>" >}}harmful weight-loss strategies{{< /external-link >}}. NEDA faced backlash and had to shut the system down, which shows how untested AI can cause real damage. Businesses that rely on AI agents cannot afford such mistakes.

## How Genezio handles AI third-party testing

Genezio offers an AI third-party testing solution designed to validate AI agents before and during deployment. This makes sure AI agents work as intended and don't trigger expensive problems.

The process is simple. Businesses choose the AI agents they want to test, and Genezio runs simulations with multiple agents in different environments. These tests check accuracy, compliance, and reliability under different conditions, including real-world case scenarios. You can even get started by **pasting a URL** that invokes an AI agent.

A common concern with AI is system prompt exposure. AI agents sometimes expose internal instructions or sensitive information, which can create security vulnerabilities. Genezio identifies these risks before they become serious problems. The same goes for AI going off-topic --- like chatbots answering technical questions with poems. Testing prevents these kinds of failures.

Businesses can get one-time reports or set up continuous monitoring to track AI performance over time. This way, they stay ahead of problems instead of reacting after something goes wrong. With Genezio, companies don't have to guess whether their AI agents will work correctly --- they can test them upfront and keep them reliable in the long run.

### AI testing as a business requirement

In their original post, Anthropic argues that AI testing should be a legal requirement. But for businesses, it's already an operational necessary. As mentioned, deploying untested AI agents exposes companies to financial risks, brand damage, and regulatory scrutiny. That's why AI independent testing is so important: It proves that AI agents work reliably throughout their lifecycles.

So, actually, what Anthropic implies should be a legal requirement might be something else entirely: a real business necessity.

## Make AI reliable with AI third-party testing

AI failures can be costly, but they don't have to be. Genezio's AI third-party testing helps businesses catch issues before they cause real damage. With automated simulations and real-world case scenarios, you can test AI agents for accuracy, compliance, and reliability --- all before they go live.

Some businesses need a one-time validation, while others require continuous monitoring. Genezio makes AI testing easy in both cases. You get clear reports, real issue detection, and confidence that your AI agents won't put your business at risk.

**If you're ready to test your AI agents properly, get started today.**
