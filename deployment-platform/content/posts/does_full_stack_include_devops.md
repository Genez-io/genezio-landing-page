When it comes to building apps, you’ll often hear about “full-stack” and, rightfully so, wonder if it includes “DevOps.” But not really. DevOps, the bit that would help a developer deploy their newly-coded app, is not part of the full-stack skill set. Full-stack is about building the app itself from start to finish, while DevOps focuses on making sure it works properly once it's built and running. And, if they know with which platforms to work with, developers are not expected to master the two.

Reports suggest that, DevOps knowledge or not, just about every programmer out there understands that deploying quickly and without hassles is worthwhile. A Harvard Business Review survey found that while 86% of professionals {{< external-link link="https://hbr.org/sponsored/2019/01/competitive-advantage-through-devops" >}}recognize the importance{{< /external-link >}} of quick software releases, only 10% feel their companies succeed at it. The technicalities of DevOps often contribute to this gap. And fortunately for developers who haven’t mastered the discipline, there are cloud platforms like Genezio that simplify deployment and can close this divide.

This article will explain the roles of full-stack and DevOps, why full-stack developers don’t need DevOps skills, and how Genezio can bridge the gap to make app deployment easier.

## What is full-stack development?

Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end parts of an application. This includes everything from designing user interfaces with frameworks like React or Vue to setting up databases and APIs. They’re responsible for bringing a feature from design to implementation, and this might ultimately require covering every layer of the stack.

Still, while full-stack developers can be involved with some server-related tasks, their main focus is on writing the code for the app itself. They might know the basics of how servers work or write simple scripts to automate specific tasks, but managing servers or handling large-scale infrastructure responsibilities like maintaining uptime or automating pipelines typically falls outside their duties.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is about making sure that the development process runs properly and that the app is ready for production — basically, the behind-the-scenes work that keeps the app running once it's been built. This includes setting up servers, automating deployment, and guaranteeing the app remains available for users, even as it grows.

In simple terms, while full-stack developers focus on writing the code for the app, DevOps professionals handle the infrastructure that supports it. They manage tasks like containerization, monitoring, and scaling — things developers usually don’t have to think about — to keep the app running without interruption.

## Does full-stack include DevOps?

No, full-stack doesn’t include DevOps. Full-stack development doesn’t address the deeper operational duties that DevOps covers. While full-stack developers may occasionally handle basic server configurations or troubleshoot infrastructure, tasks like deploying and maintaining production environments are usually outside their reach. Though the two roles supplement each other, trying to juggle both can make it really hard for developers to succeed in either.

So, if full-stack development doesn’t typically include DevOps, how can you make deployment easier without becoming an expert in both fields? This is where specialized cloud platforms like {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/" >}}Genezio{{< /external-link >}} come in.

## How Genezio can help you with your app’s deployment

Genezio makes it possible to deploy full-stack projects without diving into DevOps. By connecting your GitHub repository to Genezio, you can import, configure, and deploy your projects in just {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/import-github-projects-genezio/#step-by-step-guide-to-importing-and-deploying-your-project" >}}a few steps{{< /external-link >}}. Here’s how it works:

### 1. Import your repository

Once you connect your GitHub account, Genezio lets you select and import your project. It detects your framework automatically if you’re using supported tools like Next.js, Express.js, React, or Vue.

### 2. Configure settings

Genezio applies customized build and deployment settings based on your framework. If you need specific settings, you can adjust build commands, output directories, or environment variables directly in the platform.

### 3. Deploy in minutes

With a single click on the “Deploy” button, your project goes live. Genezio handles the infrastructure, so you don’t have to worry about servers, pipelines, or scaling. Updates are automatic, too — every push to your main branch redeploys your app without the need for manual intervention.

### 4. See your live app

Once deployed, Genezio provides you with a URL where your app is hosted. If you want to have a more personalized web address, you can easily add a custom domain. Your project is now ready — you have just shipped, even without knowing about DevOps!

### Who takes care of infrastructure if there’s no DevOps specialist?

Considering a full-stack developer who doesn’t know about DevOps will struggle to scratch out a deployment, are they expected to manage the servers and infrastructure now that the app is live? Not really. Considering Genezio can actually automate a development process by importing the codebase from GitHub, then, ideally, Genezio should also carry out the server maintenance and scaling.

And that’s precisely what Genezio or any serverless platform will do. “Serverless” means that the provider, in this case, Genezio, will handle the servers, its security, and its scalability if there’s substantial demand.

So, if you’re a standalone developer or part of a technical team that doesn’t have a DevOps specialist, you can rely on the platform to deploy and to keep your app up and running.

## Why Genezio stands out as a deployment platform for full-stack developers

Genezio is a full-stack cloud platform focused on making the deployment process as simple as possible. Genezio is a great solution for companies with outdated infrastructure or for developers who are new to deployment. As a serverless platform, Genezio takes care of DevOps and server maintainance. That’s why it allows developers to skip the server-side complexities so they can stay focused on improving their code and building new features users can interact with.

If you want to spend less time on deployment and more time building, Genezio is the platform to explore. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, Genezio makes launching and deploying full-stack apps easy and quick.
