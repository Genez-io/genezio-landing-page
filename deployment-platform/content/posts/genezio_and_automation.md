In the modern digital landscape, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and web services have become the backbone of many business operations, facilitating seamless communication between different software systems and enabling the delivery of business logic at scale.

As businesses have leveraged their APIs to do more with greater efficiency, automation has time and time again shown itself to be an effective tool in the API toolkit. Automation plays a crucial role by handling repetitive tasks efficiently, streamlining processes and enhancing business outcomes.

## Understanding Automation in APIs and Web Services

Automation is an incredibly powerful tool in the API arsenal – but what is it, exactly?

Put simply, automation uses systems to manage tasks or processes that would otherwise incur a manual cost in attention, effort, or operation. These tasks and processes typically include things like data entry, resource creation, server maintenance, and so on, and the costs incurred for each discrete function are typically small individually but massive at scale.

Automation can be used to mitigate the costs of these systems at scale – since each individual piece of the puzzle is a very small processing load that adds up in mass, automation systems need to balance efficacy and efficiency against a body of processes and systems. This is typically done through scripts, specialized APIs or software solutions, and trigger-based systems that enact functionality based upon a certain state.

### Benefits of Automation

This approach of mitigating costs at scale through automation can reap huge benefits!

Firstly, automation increases efficiency and productivity of the entire system. These individual tasks are typically resource intensive only at scale, but the sheer amount of processes and systems in play means that you can’t handle each individual task by itself without quickly becoming overwhelmed. Automation helps to “level the playing field”, reducing the impact of and resources dedicated to these problems. This results in quicker task completion, freeing up resources for strategic processes and functions that may be more impactful.

Automation can also result in increased accuracy and consistency. Because there are so many moving pieces involved that add up to something larger, it can be difficult to standardize your approach across the entire body of issues. Automating the problem involves setting rules and triggers, which creates a standardization which can control the overall form and function of this body of interactions. This can result in more standard, accurate, and consistent handling than would otherwise be enabled through manual handling.

This approach also results in pretty significant cost reductions, both in hard monetary sense and in resource allocation. Automation reduces the need for manual interaction, reducing the overall cost of the system and freeing up resources to be dedicated elsewhere. Instead of dedicating entire teams or functions to handling small routine tasks, those resources can be dedicated to other productive or revenue-driving systems while these smaller tasks are handled through automation. Automation can also help reduce or minimize the risk of errors resulting from lacking accuracy or consistency, thereby generating substantial savings.

Finally, automation unlocks scalability and extensibility in a significant way. Automation can unlock serverless and other strategies which allow for more rapid and effective scaling and extension that would otherwise require significant investments in time and attention. Process automation can help make systems more extensible and efficient, reducing the cost of expansion.

### Drawbacks of Automation

While the benefits are compelling, automation does carry its own challenges.

Typically, there are costs incurred with cold starts in the automation space. A cold start is when a server or resource is “spun up” to meet the need of a task through automated systems. Many automation solutions suffer from this cost, which can reduce the efficiency and savings of such an approach. Any chosen automation solution is going to live and die by how much the cold start cost is mitigated.

Automation solutions can also result in a dependency on a given solution, also called vendor lock-in. Vendors who provide an extremely specific solution that requires you to use their code, their approach, and their framework of choice can lock in your solution. While there are automation solutions which are framework agnostic and open to your own solutions, others who do not fit this bill are quite commonplace, generating a common trap for adoptees. Gains in process automation efficiency must be balanced against the cost to achieve them in the long-term.

Relatedly, how this automation is done is a vital consideration. There are many low-code or no-code solutions which promise automation and scalability, they often carry their own restrictions. These restrictions can result in unforeseen consequences which can dramatically undermine your automation and result in massive inefficiency. A good solution should allow you to code without restrictions, but many automation systems are more concerned with selling you their solution rather than the right solution.

## Genezio Unlocks Automation (And Freedom!)

Genezio is a serverless solution that unlocks automation at scale in a very unique value offering. With Genezio, there is no vendor lock-in – Genezio ensures that you own your code, your databases, and your automation framework, sidestepping the common pitfall of vendor and solution lock-in.

Notably, this also extends to code and framework choices. Because Genezio is framework agnostic, you are free to determine your own development paradigm and systems without incurring inefficiency costs or being blocked by tool demands. Substantial support for cron jobs and dynamic authentication systems means that you can craft the automation system you need instead of adopting the system a vendor thinks you need – you are in the driver seat!

Genezio unlocks massive efficiency, but perhaps its biggest selling point as an automation system is the dynamic way in which it connects its serverless functionality at scale. Genezio is able to unlock serverless solutions with zero cold start cost for the end user – this is a huge deal, and mitigates the main cost that is incurred with automation systems. Being able to dodge the cold start problem means that you are able to truly leverage dynamic resourcing and serverless at scale in a way that is hard to achieve with other solutions.

## Conclusion

Automation offers massive benefits in the API space by reducing cost, improving efficiency and standardization of data flow, and generally improving the functionality of underlying services. Not all automation solutions are created equally, however, and Genezio presents a unique value proposition for a wide range of users. Deploying Genezio means reaping the benefits of automation while avoiding the most common pitfalls of such an approach. Process automation can save you time, resources, and money – and Genezio gives you this power in addition to control over the code flow and structure.
