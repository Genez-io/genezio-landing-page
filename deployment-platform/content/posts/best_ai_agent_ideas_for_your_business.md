AI adoption in business {{< external-link link="<https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250123-3>" >}}is growing{{< /external-link >}} because companies want to rely on them. AI agents, like chatbots and virtual assistants, are helping businesses speed up their operations in areas like customer relations. Businesses can now hand over some repetitive tasks---like sorting out support tickets or like answering some frequently-asked queries---to AI agents. Yet, despite the rise of AI in businesses, many customers still aren't fully confident about it.

A recent survey by Omnisend found that {{< external-link link="<https://www.omnisend.com/blog/ai-trust-and-data-privacy-ecommerce/>" >}}39% of shoppers{{< /external-link >}} abandoned purchases due to poor AI interactions --- which came either from unhelpful chatbots, bad recommendations, or simply because they felt like the technology wasn't working for them. What's more, 48% of shoppers said they'd most like to see improvements in customer service through AI. This shows that while customers are open to AI, it doesn't always meet their expectations, especially in customer service.

This is a challenge for businesses: AI is only useful if it is also reliable. If it causes more frustration than it solves, customers will quickly turn away. For e-commerce companies, this can lead to lost sales, damage to their reputation, or customers seeking alternatives. That's why testing AI agents is a business imperative. With **regular testing and simulations**, businesses and Customer Care Executives can make sure their AI agents are delivering accurate, helpful responses and providing the kind of service that keeps customers happy.

In this article, we'll look at some of the best AI agent ideas for your business and explain how the right AI testing solution can prevent failures and keep your AI agents reliable.

## What are AI agents?

AI agents are software programs that handle tasks automatically and on a step-by-step basis, often using language models to understand and respond to human input. Businesses use them for customer support, data analysis, and task automation. In 2025, most chatbots, virtual assistants, and recommendation systems rely on AI agents.

But while they can be useful, **AI agents aren't always reliable**. They might give competent-looking answers that are completely off or misinterpret what a user needs, or make decisions that don't follow business rules. For companies, these mistakes can mean lost revenue, frustrated customers, or even legal trouble. That's why AI testing solutions like Genezio, a **platform to test AI agents**, are so important. These solutions make sure AI agents perform as expected and don't turn into costly liabilities.

## AI agent ideas for your business

There are plenty of AI agent ideas out there, but some stand out as especially useful. Here are a few of the best ways businesses can use AI agents:

### AI that replies to support emails

This AI agent idea comes from a real-world use: {{< external-link link="<https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bernhardhauser_i-built-an-ai-agent-inside-gmail-that-can-ugcPost-7304910969984499712-RcwQ/>" >}}an AI assistant{{< /external-link >}} that reads incoming support emails, checks knowledge base articles, and drafts replies. If it's confident in the answer, it sends the reply automatically. Otherwise, it flags the response for human review.

Now, Customer Care Executives should consider that an agent like this one (either the solution we're mentioning here or any other) could reply with something that is off-limits. So, regular testing with a platform like Genezio makes sure that the agent is actually inside the bounds you'd expect it to be.

This kind of AI agent helps decrease the need for human reps to answer repetitive questions, and in this way, speeds up customer support. Still, there is a risk that it may misinterpret a request or expose incorrect (or classified!) information, which could frustrate customers. But this risk can be easily avoided. With regular AI testing, a third-party AI tester can make sure the agent understands customer requests and provides accurate responses.

Customer Care Executives and businesses should also consider that anyone, including the competition, can try to hijack this agent to obtain classified information. So, if the AI agent is trained with the product data, it could be trained with the pricing, since many times the price lists and product information lists are the same document. So, what if a competitor obtained info about a deal or about a price by pressuring the agent into answering the email with it?

### AI agent for user behavior analysis

This AI agent tracks how users interact with a website --- such as clicks, scrolls, and time spent on pages --- to capture useful data for research. Instead of relying on manual heatmap analysis, it identifies patterns, like where users tend to drop off or which content engages them the most, and then sums up some research. (This is something at which Generative AI systems don't excel right now. They can put together pages and pages of research like no human can. But it's very, very hard to have an AI system say something actually useful or that it isn't generic or with hallucinations. That's also a reason why testing with a simulation is so important).

{{< external-link link="<https://www.hotjar.com/product-ai-surveys/>" >}}Hotjar's AI-powered{{< /external-link >}} surveys are a great example of this. Hotjar collects feedback alongside behavioral data to help businesses understand why users behave a certain way. Its AI suggests survey questions based on user actions, and makes it easier to identify friction points and improve the website experience.

The AI agent can then suggest changes, like adjusting CTA placements or fixing confusing navigation. (An ideal AI agent should also make the changes.) It can also run A/B tests on layouts or headlines to see what works better. The risk is that AI might misinterpret user behavior, and recommend changes that don't actually improve engagement. Regular AI testing helps keep it on track, as it makes sure the AI understands user behavior correctly and submits changes _that really work_.

### AI customer support chatbot

Companies like {{< external-link link="<https://forethought.ai/?source=genezio.com>" >}}Forethought{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="<https://sendbird.com/>" >}}Sendbird{{< /external-link >}} offer AI-powered customer service agents that make customer support much simpler. Forethought helps with answering common questions and forwarding tricky ones to humans. Sendbird focuses on integrating AI chatbots into messaging platforms to handle customer support chats and give quick responses. In both cases, these AI agents help businesses handle a high volume of inquiries without exhausting staff.

But AI chatbots can mess up. For instance, if a bot doesn't understand a refund question, it might respond with something like, "Thanks for reaching out!" --- not useful at all. Sometimes customers might ask random or silly things to test the bot, and it could give a completely irrelevant or off-topic answer. Worse, chatbots can sometimes spill sensitive information by mistake. For instance, if a customer asks a chatbot for personal account details, and the bot isn't properly trained, it might mistakenly share private data, and cause big security problems. This is also how a man tricked a Nissan AI agent into offering a $1 car.

This is why an AI testing solution like Genezio is so important for a Customer Care team or a business. The platform simulates and monitors the chatbot's responses for accuracy, and makes sure the AI doesn't just perform well in theory but also in real-world situations. AI testing also helps stop the bot from giving off-topic or even offensive answers. So, when the bot encounters a tricky question, it's less likely to make a mistake, and if it does, it's flagged before it reaches the customer.
