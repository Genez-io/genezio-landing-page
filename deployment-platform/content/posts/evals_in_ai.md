Using **AI** for customer service has been slowly changing how businesses talk to their customers. A 2024 Callvu study found that 57% of customers believe companies are adding **AI assistants** to customer service in order to cut costs, not improve service. Plus, the study found that live agents are rated much higher than AI on most customer service criteria like understanding complex challenges, resolving issues in one call or session, venting frustrations and offering better security and privacy.

When a chatbot fails to understand a query, spits out outdated or biased information, or simply loops endlessly, it frustrates users, it costs companies, either because that chatbot is costing money, or because it‚Äôs earning them reputational damage. That is why **evals in AI** make certain that your **AI agents** actually work as intended and comply with your customer‚Äôs expectations.

In this article, we‚Äôll run through what evals are and how **Genezio** makes it possible to test agents properly, even for teams without technical expertise.

## What are Evals in AI

**Evals in AI** are structured assessments that measure how well an **AI** system performs a specific task. For customer service bots, this means seeing how well the agent understands customer queries, how accurately it responds, and how closely its tone and behavior align with brand values. You should check to see if your chatbot can deal with ambiguity, calm down tense conversations, and respond the same way in different situations.

Evals test **agents** in real-world, human-centric situations. Are they polite under pressure? Do they give incorrect or **hallucinated** answers? Can they adapt their tone for different users? These are the questions businesses must answer before letting a bot interact with actual customers. **Genezio** comes with a framework for doing exactly that‚Äîquickly, safely, and without training a team of developers.

### What happens when you don‚Äôt run proper evals?

In 2024, New York City learned the hard way. An **AI-powered chatbot** launched to assist small business owners with sticking to city regulations ended up dispensing dangerously false, and sometimes absurd, information. When asked about workplace rights, the bot wrongly stated that employers could legally fire workers for complaining about sexual harassment, not disclosing a pregnancy, or refusing to cut their dreadlocks.

The following table shows some of the incorrect advice the NYC chatbot provided:

| ‚ùìQuestion Submitted | ü§ñ NYC Chatbot Answer | üèôÔ∏è Reality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Are buildings required to accept section 8 vouchers? | ‚Äú No, buildings are not required to accept Section 8 vouchers. ‚Äù | Landlords cannot discriminate by source of income, with a minor exception for small buildings where the landlord or their family lives. |
| Do landlords have to accept tenants on rental assistance? | ‚Äú No, landlords are not required to accept tenants on rental assistance. ‚Äù | Landlords cannot discriminate by source of income, with a minor exception for small buildings where the landlord or their family lives. |

And in one particularly surreal exchange, the **AI** asserted that restaurants could serve cheese that had been partially eaten by a rat, so long as they assessed the ‚Äúextent of the damage‚Äù and ‚Äúinformed customers about the situation.‚Äù The city then went ahead and defended their faulty bot and claimed that these types of mistakes are a part of the process of adoption of new technologies. However, there are ways to avoid chatbots giving out illegal advice.

Incidents like this highlight why comprehensive **evals in AI** are essential before releasing any **generative AI** system to the public.
