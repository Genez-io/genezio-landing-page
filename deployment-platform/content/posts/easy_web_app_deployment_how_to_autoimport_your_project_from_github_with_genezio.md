Deploying a web app can be more of a tedious job than a step forward. According to a December 2024 AWS blog post,developers report spending an average of {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-q-developer-generate-documentation-source-code/?nc1=h_ls" >}}just one hour per day on coding{{< /external-link >}}, with the rest of their time tied up in tasks like managing deployments, writing documentation, and troubleshooting issues.

But with tools like DeployApps, developers can shift the focus back to what really matters: building great apps. This is especially true because DeployApps helps full-stack developers without DevOps knowledge deploy their apps, and keep the infrastructure running and scaling up. DeployApps’s GitHub auto-import feature makes deployment quick and simple, so developers can launch their project in just a few steps without dealing with server-side tasks or having to binge-watch DevOps tutorials on YouTube.

This article walks through how developers can autoimport projects to deploy them, why doing this is actually a great strategy for easy web app deployment, and who gets the most value out of a simple, cloud-based platform.

## What is web app deployment?

Web app deployment means installing a piece of software in an environment so that anyone can access it through a browser.

Web apps are software pieces running on a browser. A solution like a PDF converter or a paid-time off tracker required software to be installed on a desktop computer. That’s not the case anymore, since plenty of full-stack developers run applications — not websites! Applications — that are accessible from a browser. These apps need to be deployed into a server that can handle traffic and host the solution to which a user accesses through a URL. But plenty of full-stack engineers still admit that they’re not used to DevOps and struggle to deploy their web apps. That’s why an autoimport feature is so handy.

## What is DeployApps?

{{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/" >}}DeployApps{{< /external-link >}} is a full-stack cloud platform designed to simplify web app deployment. Compared with traditional platforms that request for tons of wiring or DevOps know-how, DeployApps automates most of the setup. It connects directly to your GitHub repository, detects your framework, and deploys your app with very little input from you.

The platform will be interesting to developers who need quick and easy app deployment. DeployApps handles the heavy lifting and takes care of the servers, the security, and the scaling. It’s a serverless platform, meaning that a SaaS or MVP alike will automatically scale up when the demand dictates it.

## How DeployApps works for easy web app deployment

Getting started with DeployApps is simple. First, you {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/import" >}}import your GitHub{{< /external-link >}} repository. The platform then figures out which framework you’re using — whether it’s React, Next.js, or something else. Most projects are ready to deploy right away, though you can still adjust settings if you want.

Once your project is imported, deployment is just a click away. DeployApps manages servers, server security, scaling, and updates automatically. For developers, this means no configuring pipelines or dealing with unexpected server issues. Updates to your app are just as simple — when you push changes to your main branch, the platform automatically redeploys your app.

## Why full-stack developers choose DeployApps to deploy apps

Traditional deployment usually means setting up servers, configuring CI/CD pipelines, and making sure your app can handle growth. Thankfully, DeployApps takes care of all that for you. For example, let’s say you’re an IT representative for a company, and you’ve built a PTO request web app so that the HR team can share it with every employee. You can always use your company’s cluttered Pentium III servers, or, you can simply deploy it on DeployApps’s free starter plan to test your idea without the stress of infrastructure management.

DeployApps also works with any framework and supports tools like Upstash Redis and Neon Postgres. This means you won’t get locked into any specific stack, so you can use the tools you're most comfortable with, or the ones that make the most sense for your project. (Vendor lock-in is an uncomfortable side effect of cloud computing, and DeployApps was deliberately built to fight lock-in).

## For SaaS developers: keep it simple with pure cloud-based deployment

If you’re building a SaaS application, you’ll probably want to go with a cloud-based model. It’s the classic SaaS setup — your app lives in the cloud, and customers access it through their browsers. Simple, right?

There are other “SaaS-like” solutions out there, like managed services that are hosted on the customer’s cloud. But those aren’t really pure SaaS models. They’re more like managed services. Take {{< external-link link="https://www.databricks.com/" >}}Databricks{{< /external-link >}}, for example — they use this approach.

Running a managed service can get messy fast. What if your customer uses GCP, but your app is built around AWS? Or they want an on-premise version? These demands can quickly spiral into a headache, especially if your infrastructure isn’t flexible.

Pure SaaS deployment avoids all these potential problems. If you want your pure SaaS to scale without hidden complexities or infrastructure hassles, DeployApps will surely help you out. With DeployApps, you focus on your app, and the platform takes care of the rest. And if you have built a fantastic SaaS product but, as a solo developer, don’t know how to deploy it so it can handle prospective traffic spikes, then the platform should have you covered thanks to autoimport and autoscaling.

## Who benefits most from DeployApps?

DeployApps is ideal for developers without DevOps skills and for IT professionals in companies with outdated infrastructure. If your focus is on building great apps, but you find deployment intimidating, DeployApps makes up for the gap.

It’s also a great choice for startups. You can scale your app without extra effort, as DeployApps’s infrastructure adapts to sudden surges. The idea is: Don’t pay for computing power you’re not using, and don’t miss out on a huge demand just because your environment isn’t ready and falls apart when traffic spikes. Even for experienced developers, DeployApps simplifies deployment and allows you to spend more time refining your app and less time worrying about servers.

## Choose DeployApps for easy web app deployment

Many platforms promise to simplify deployment, but DeployApps’s combination of automation, framework detection, and GitHub integration makes it a standout solution for easy web app deployment. You can auto-import your project straight from GitHub and have it live in no time. You won’t have to deal with complicated setups and server-side configurations.

If you’re already comfortable with GitHub, you’ll feel right at home with how DeployApps works. It’s also a great option for beginners looking for a quick way to get their apps online. For experienced developers, DeployApps is a great tool to skip the repetitive tasks and spend more time coding.

SaaS developers will also appreciate how DeployApps keeps things simple with its pure cloud-based model. There’s no need to juggle different environments or worry about scaling — DeployApps handles the tricky stuff, so you can focus entirely on refining your app.

Plus, DeployApps is **affordable**. The free plan is very generous.
