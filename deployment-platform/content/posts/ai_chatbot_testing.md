AI chatbots are quickly becoming the first level of assistance for customer service. As businesses race to automate support across platforms like WhatsApp, websites, and voice assistants, the margin for error grows wider---and the cost of those errors more public. As these tools become smarter and more independent, the risks of miscommunication, {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/blog/llm-hallucination-detection/>" >}}hallucinations{{< /external-link >}}, and brand-damaging errors increase. A {{< external-link link="<https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-09-gartner-survey-finds-64-percent-of-customers-would-prefer-that-companies-didnt-use-ai-for-customer-service>" >}}Gartner{{< /external-link >}} survey finds 64% of customers would prefer that companies didn't use AI for customer service. This speaks to companies' disregard of AI chatbot testing to ensure consistent and helpful customer support.

In this article, we'll explain why you should do simultaneous AI chatbot testing with tools such as Genezio before entrusting customer service to a gen AI.

## AI Agents are taking over customer support, and some issues are cropping up

AI agents have evolved far beyond rule-based bots that could only offer preset responses. Today's AI chatbots---built on large language models like GPT and others---can carry on human-like conversations, sort complex customer requests, and even act autonomously to solve problems. While the increase in complexity is impressive, it also means that testing and making sure that AI chatbots are consistent will be much harder.

If your chatbot is answering customers on WhatsApp, your website, and over the phone through a voice interface, how do you certify that it's saying the right thing on every platform? What if it quotes the wrong refund policy on WhatsApp, gives outdated pricing info on your site, and confuses callers with convoluted voice prompts?

### When chatbots go rogue

In July 2022, {{< external-link link="<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/air-canada-chatbot-lawsuit>" >}}Air Canada{{< /external-link >}} made headlines for all the wrong reasons when its AI-powered chatbot misinformed a customer about bereavement fares. The bot told a man he could retroactively apply a discount after purchasing his ticket for his grandmother's funeral. But when he contacted support for reimbursement, the airline refused, and claimed the bot was a "separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions". The issue escalated to small claims court, where the judge ruled against the airline, and stated that Air Canada is responsible for all information provided by its chatbot. The company had to reimburse the ticket and pay damages.

This wasn't a minor error. It demonstrated how a single misleading response from an AI agent---especially one acting as an official voice of a brand---can lead to legal, financial, and reputational damage.

As companies embrace AI across different channels, they face a growing challenge: how do you guarantee that AI chatbot testing ensures consistency, reliability, and truthfulness across all chatbot interfaces?

## Why AI chatbot testing is so important

As the Air Canada example showed, chatbot errors are brand liabilities. When an AI chatbot goes off-script, it frustrates customers, it undermines trust, creates PR nightmares, and can even cause legal problems. And because AI models don't operate on hard-coded scripts, they need to be tested in more dynamic and context-aware ways than traditional software.

Today's companies aren't just deploying one chatbot. They're deploying fleets of AI agents: some chat via text on a website, others respond to customers over WhatsApp, and many are now handling voice interactions via phone. Each channel introduces unique risks. It may answer one way on WhatsApp and completely differently on the website---which results in confusion, frustration, or worse, public backlash.

Traditional QA methods don't scale with this complexity. Testing each chatbot individually, across every platform and integration, is time-consuming and expensive. Worse yet, it doesn't reflect the real-world customer journey, which often flows across multiple platforms.

This is why companies need a centralized approach, a unified way to {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/blog/ai-third-party-testing/>" >}}third-party test all their AI-powered chatbots{{< /external-link >}} in one place. Thankfully, Genezio has you covered with its AI chatbot testing.

## Genezio's AI chatbot testing across platforms: AI Chatbot Testing for Non-Technical Stakeholders

Genezio offers a solution especially designed for this AI-first support era. If you're a company using AI chatbots across WhatsApp, voice, and web, Genezio enables you to test them all from a single interface.

The most effective AI chatbot testing is running realistic scenarios that mimic user's actual behaviors rather than ideal customer conditions. Genezio generates a simulation where your bot faces incorrect spellings, sensitive questions, unpredictable input and even malicious user prompts. Genezio also reports common {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/blog/llm-anomaly-detection/>" >}}AI anomalies{{< /external-link >}} like hallucinations and prompt injection attacks and tracks how frequently they appear across cases. This way you can be sure you can fully trust your AI agent even under pressure.

Genezio's AI chatbot testing doesn't stop after launching. If you choose to, you can keep monitoring your agent and {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/blog/test-ai-agent/>" >}}track behavioral shifts{{< /external-link >}} over time so you can tackle possible problems early on.

### How Genezio's tool works

Genezio's AI chatbot testing tool is designed to support you throughout the entire lifecycle of your AI chatbot before it ever goes live. You can begin by pasting a URL or connecting your agent directly, and Genezio will simulate real customer interactions---such as confusing prompts, repeated questions, and edge cases---to test how well your agent performs under pressure.

Once your chatbot is live, Genezio continues working in the background. And when things do go wrong, Genezio provides detailed logs, identifies patterns, and highlights examples of risky responses, so you can narrow down the issue and patch it quickly.

## Try Genezio for Unified AI Chatbot Testing

If your business is using AI to power customer support on multiple platforms, you can't afford to test those chatbots in isolation. Genezio makes it easy to run automated, real-world tests across WhatsApp, voice, and web chatbots---all from a single dashboard. You will get detailed reports with clear explanations on how to target them, whether you choose a one-time test or ongoing monitoring.

Genezio's scope currently focuses on text agents, so depending on your solution layout, you might be able to also test voice agents, especially if they're powered by an LLM.

Don't wait for a viral PR nightmare to realize your chatbot isn't behaving as it should. **Book a demo and get your free {{< external-link link="<https://genezio.com/#cta-buttons>" >}}AI chatbot testing with Genezio{{< /external-link >}}.**
