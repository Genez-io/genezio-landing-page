Cloud hosting can be affordable—until it’s {{< external-link link="https://www.techradar.com/pro/cloud-bills-are-rising-for-businesses-of-all-sizes" >}}suddenly not{{< /external-link >}}. Sure thing: Its affordability (a nicer way of saying that it’s cheap, as in, it doesn’t cost much money) is built into how the providers pack and sell it. Developers run applications and websites on virtual servers, which they simply rent from a cloud provider. So, the provider made the bigger purchase and now offers you resources for a dollar's worth. Given how, in some cases, they’re renting out just a tiny fraction of their computing capacity, the cloud model certainly comes off like a model with cheap fees.

But cloud users know that invoices can spike up quickly with certain cloud providers. If you make a slight mistake in AWS or Azure and you incorrectly configure an API call, you’ll be greeted with hefty bills—and no real customer support to hear you out. Cloud providers usually avoid flat fees, and that’s how they get away with outrageous charges.

Let’s check out if there are still any affordable cloud hosting solutions or providers and detail their prices.

## What is the most affordable cloud hosting in 2025?

The most affordable cloud hosting is {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/" >}}Genezio{{< /external-link >}}. The platform is designed with developers in mind, so keeping it affordable while guaranteeing peak performance is at the top of the list of priorities.

Genezio is affordable because its starter plan is very generous. But also because it’s a serverless platform where developers don’t need to take care of the server-side of things. We’ll get into that later on.

Let’s start with the price tag. The Hobby plan, Genezio’s free tier, is perfect for prototyping or showing off side projects, and there’s no time limit on how long you can stay on the free plan. Unlike many other platforms, Genezio’s free tier is truly free and scalable, so you can start small and grow your app without worrying about hitting limits or unexpected charges. For those ready to scale, the Pro plan is just $15 per month, with up to 10 seats across all your projects. Genezio Functions automatically scale with demand to provide the ideal output while keeping costs under control—you can invoke 2 million functions each month without paying an additional dime. Genezio also makes your work easier by having features like logging in, managing databases, and scheduling tasks.

Best of all, Genezio’s pricing model is clear and straightforward—no hidden fees or surprise bills. You’ll always know exactly what to expect, so it's a budget-friendly choice for developers at any stage.

Since you don’t have to take care of security patches or server maintenance, you can also offset those invisible costs from your budget. Besides the generous Hobby plan, this is also what makes Genezio the most affordable cloud hosting out there.

## Competitor analysis: why other platforms are more expensive

To finally confirm why Genezio is the most affordable cloud hosting solution, we must play it fair and compare it against other top cloud providers. All of these cloud providers are industry leaders or shook the market when they dropped, but they’re no longer affordable, or, in any case, they’re not as affordable as Genezio. Here we go:

### Heroku

{{< external-link link="https://www.heroku.com/" >}}Heroku{{< /external-link >}} is one of the most popular and established platforms among developers. It's often been praised for being so affordable. In case you're among the OG developers who think Heroku still has a free, albeit not entirely dependable, free plan, then we're breaking it for you: Heroku discontinued its free plans in 2022. Yes, sad news.

Users must now opt for a paid plan, which can quickly become more costly depending on the scale and complexity of their applications. Just the basic plan to test ideas or run apps with intermittent use starts at US $5 per month. And that $5 is so confusing to set up that some projects end up paying more than that because the server sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity, which means some developers might desperately need to upgrade their plan on the spot for a demo. The plan right afterward starts at $7 a month. While Heroku remains a reputable platform, it is no longer an affordable option for developers looking to cut their hosting costs.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

{{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" >}}Amazon’s AWS Elastic Beanstalk{{< /external-link >}} is a typical solution for users to deploy and scale web applications. While Beanstalk itself is free, AWS’s pricing can be complex because there are no specific pricing tiers. It depends on the underlying AWS resources being used. What you pay depends on the standard AWS pricing, which is subject to changes. Many users end up paying for more resources than they actually use due to AWS’s default configurations, which can drive up costs disproportionately.

### Netifly

{{< external-link link="https://www.netlify.com/" >}}Netlify’s{{< /external-link >}} free tier is packed with great features like continuous deployment, a global CDN, 100 GB of bandwidth, and basic serverless functions, with the option to add extras. Paid plans, starting at $19/month, open up even more tools like identity management. Still, if the free tier’s bandwidth is taken up, it generates an automatic charge of US $55/100 GB, even if you have not uploaded any billing information. This way, users are left exposed to unexpected bills during traffic spikes, even if they didn't consent to paying anything in the first place. Some free-tier users have been receiving {{< external-link link="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39520776" >}}significant surcharges{{< /external-link >}} due to DDoS attacks—like, shouldn’t the provider handle those, as true serverless providers do?

### Vercel

{{< external-link link="https://vercel.com/" >}}Vercel{{< /external-link >}} offers three plans: Hobby, Pro, and Enterprise. The Hobby plan, which is free, comes with plenty of useful features like CLI and Git integrations, built-in CI/CD, automatic HTTPS/SSL, and preview deployments for every Git push. It also includes resources for Vercel Functions, Edge Middleware, and Image Optimization, plus 100 GB of Fast Data Transfer and 1 hour of runtime logs.

If you’re looking to scale, though, costs can add up. The Pro plan is $20 per month per team seat, so each team member adds $20 to the monthly bill, plus any additional resource usage. For example, a solo developer gets 1 TB of bandwidth for $20/month, but for a team of 10 developers working on the same project, it’s $200/month for the same 1 TB of bandwidth—not 10 TB.

## Genezio is a budget-friendly cloud solution for full-stack apps

Genezio is the most affordable option in a cloud hosting market. Since it’s serverless, it won’t sacrifice performance because the solution is designed to handle traffic spikes without caving in (and without invoicing fortunes for staying online). While competitors like Heroku, AWS, Netifly, and Vercel are all very well established, their high costs, confusing pricing models, or unexpected fees can make them less economical or reasonable for many developers.

Genezio takes a different approach (flat fees—nothing too unconventional) and focuses on transparency, affordability, scalability, and simplicity. With pricing models that are up to six times more affordable than traditional solutions, it's the best choice for developers who want reliable hosting that won't break their budget.
