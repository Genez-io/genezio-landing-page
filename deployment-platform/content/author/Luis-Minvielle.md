description: "Luis Minvielle is a writer with over 5 years of experience in the software sector. Even though he mainly worked in tech, a sector he regularly publishes about, his initial incursions into writing were, oddly enough, music essays—most likely to deal with his unrealized ambitions of becoming a songwriter. And, yes—Luis strongly disagrees with every generic LinkedIn post that claims that reading a — character is a confirmation of AI-written text."
