The digital landscape is shifting globally. While the battle for user attention used to be fought exclusively on the Google Search Results Page (SERP), today, a significant part of the discovery phase is moving toward conversational interfaces. Users, particularly Gen Z, are no longer just looking for links - they want direct answers provided by platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity.
For BCR, adapting to this new reality was a strategic necessity. Here is how the bank’s Digital Marketing team turned the uncertainty of AI into a coherent visibility strategy using Genezio.

## The SEO vs. GEO Challenge: Moving from Keywords to Conversational Intent

The team noticed a fundamental shift in consumer behavior: users are becoming more pragmatic and cautious. While Google Search remains king for transactional intent (e.g., "I want a loan now"), the critical research and comparison phase is migrating toward LLMs (Large Language Models).

However, the team identified several main obstacles:

* **Lack of Visibility in the AI "Black Box":** It was difficult to know if the brand was being recommended by ChatGPT.
* **The Need for Data for Stakeholders:** To justify marketing budgets, the team needed clear metrics rather than intuition to present to top management.
* **Brand Perception:** There was a need to position the bank not just as a secure institution, but as a tech-savvy financial partner accessible to younger generations.

## The Solution: Daily Integration and Scenario-Based Optimization

The partnership with Genezio allowed the bank to make a critical transition from classic Keyword Research to Scenario Research. Instead of optimizing for isolated keywords, the team began optimizing for complex questions and real-life scenarios.

### Daily Monitoring and Opportunity Scouting

Integrating Genezio into their daily workflow proved to be a game-changer. The team now constantly monitors their standing per topic and scenario, actively looking for growth opportunities. A key advantage is the ability to perform "gap analysis" directly in the platform: seeing exactly where competitors have visibility and the bank does not. This insight allows them to spot missed opportunities instantly and adjust their tactics to capture that share of voice.

### Strategic Planning Based on LLM Sources

The team took a reverse-engineering approach for their future strategy. By analyzing the specific data sources that LLMs cite and trust, they built their entire content strategy for the upcoming year. Using Genezio’s data, they understood that AI algorithms prefer specific content types: objective comparative analyses and educational guides, rather than purely promotional text.

The platform provided structured content briefs specifically designed to be easily "read" by bots:
* Usage of lists and logical structures (bullet points).
* Tackling "comparative analysis" topics (e.g., Fixed vs. Variable Rate Mortgages).
* Focus on financial education and clarity.

### Measurable Visibility and Results

Genezio provided a clear metric: the Visibility Score. This indicator became the currency in discussions with the management team, offering a clear picture of the bank's position in AI responses compared to competitors. Furthermore, the Confidence Level metric helped eliminate statistical uncertainty, giving the data the accuracy needed for high-level business decisions.

### Winning the Trust of Algorithms (and Humans)

The impact of using Genezio was visible in a **60% Success Rate**: Following content optimization based on Genezio analyses, approximately 60% of published articles began appearing in AI recommendations (ChatGPT, AI Overviews).

### Next-Level Content Generation

While the current strategy relies on expert human writing guided by Genezio briefs, the team also got an exclusive preview of the platform’s upcoming Content Generation feature. The team was pleasantly surprised by the quality and nuance of the generated draft, noting that it managed to capture the brand's tone and the technical depth required for financial topics far better than generic tools. This successful pilot has created high anticipation within the team, who are eager to fully test and integrate this feature to scale their content production without compromising on quality.

## The Results: Winning the Trust of Algorithms (and Humans)

The impact of using Genezio was visible in 60% Success Rate: Following content optimization based on Genezio analyses, approximately 60% of published articles began appearing in AI recommendations (ChatGPT, AI Overviews).

## Conclusion: Why the Best Strategy Combines Traditional SEO with AI Insights

The BCR case study demonstrates that the most effective digital strategy is not about choosing between traditional search and AI, but mastering both. While traditional SEO remains a fundamental pillar for transactional intent, Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) has become the critical layer needed to capture the conversational research phase.
By integrating Genezio, BCR - part of the Erste Group - did not replace their existing efforts but expanded them. They proved that a hybrid approach, optimizing for both search engines and LLMs, is the only way to ensure total visibility in a fragmented digital landscape.

## FAQ

**What is the difference between SEO and GEO?**
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) focuses on increasing visibility in classic search engines, relying on backlinks and keywords. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) aims to optimize content so it can be retrieved and cited by Artificial Intelligence models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini, emphasizing authority, structure, and context.

**How is success measured in AI visibility?**
Brands use the Genezio platform to monitor the Visibility Score and Confidence Level. These indicators show how frequently and with what sentiment the brand is mentioned in AI-generated responses for specific user scenarios compared to competitors.

**Why is AI optimization important in the financial sector?**
Because users, especially younger demographics (Gen Z), are increasingly using AI assistants to compare financial products and discover offers before visiting a bank's website for the final transaction.
