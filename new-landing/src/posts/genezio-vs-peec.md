If you are evaluating tools to monitor your brand’s visibility in the era of Artificial Intelligence, you have likely encountered **Peec AI** and **Genezio**.

Both platforms help marketing teams track how they appear in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini. However, they solve the problem at different levels of depth.

The core difference is simple: **Peec AI is a monitoring tool** designed to track static prompts. **Genezio is an AI Visibility Platform** designed to analyze dynamic, multi-turn conversations and the *actual* user experience.

This guide compares the two to help you decide which platform fits your strategy.

## Quick Overview: Genezio vs. Peec AI

**Genezio** is built for **strategic optimization**. It goes beyond static prompts to simulate real-world user behavior, including multi-turn conversations, specific buyer personas, and geographic contexts. It doesn't just tell you *if* you were mentioned; it tells you *why*, by revealing the hidden queries LLMs fanout to find you.

**Peec AI** is built for simplicity and affordability. It is a great entry-level tool for teams who want to "check the box" on AI monitoring. It focuses on tracking specific prompts you define and reporting on your visibility percentage.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Peec AI | Genezio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Unit of Analysis** | Static Prompts | Full Multi-Turn Conversations |
| **Data Source** | Primarily APIs | Real Web Interfaces (Default) |
| **Target Audience** | User Context (Tags) | Deep Persona Modeling (Role, Seniority, Goals) |
| **Competitor Discovery** | Automatic + Manual Entry | Automatic Discovery (AI-driven) |
| **Geographic Precision** | Country IP filtering | Native Location-Aware Context |
| **Why it happened** | Source Citations | LLM Search Query Extraction and Source Citations |
| **Ideal For** | Basic Monitoring | Strategic Optimization & Brand Defense |

## Deep Dive: The Genezio Difference

While Peec AI offers a clean interface for tracking metrics, Genezio provides the depth required to actually *influence* the results. Here is why the difference matters.

### Real User Experience vs. API Responses
Most tools, including Peec AI, rely on APIs to check prompts. However, LLM behavior often differs significantly between the API and the web interface real users see.

**Genezio** interacts directly with LLMs through their **real web interfaces** by default. This captures the true user experience, including:
* The exact citation selection mechanisms users see.
* Safety layers and ranking logic that often don't exist in the API.
* Accurate phrasing and tone.

If you are optimizing for real customers, you need to measure what real customers see, not what a developer API returns.

### Conversations vs. Static Prompts
Peec AI tracks prompts. You input a question, and it tracks the answer.

**Genezio tracks conversations.** Real users rarely ask a single question and stop. They explore, object, and ask for clarifications. Genezio simulates these **stateful, multi-turn dialogues**.

Since conversations rarely end after the first response, Genezio continues the interaction with follow-up questions to track visibility and brand recommendation at the point where the conversation concludes, often when a decision, or even a purchase, is made.

Genezio analyzes how your brand enters or exits the consideration set as the conversation evolves. This reveals your brand's resilience under scrutiny.

### True Persona Modeling
Peec AI allows you to "tag" prompts with personas.

**Genezio injects the persona into the interaction.** A "CTO at a Fintech" receives a completely different answer from ChatGPT than a "Student looking for a bargain". Genezio defines these personas by role, seniority, company size, and goals. This ensures your visibility score reflects your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**, not a generic "average" user.

### Automatic Competitor Discovery
In Peec AI, you typically see a limited set of competitors or must manually add brands you want to compare yourself against. This creates a blind spot: you only see the competitors you already know.

**Genezio** runs an initial market scan and **automatically extracts the competitors** that LLMs are actually recommending. It frequently surfaces adjacent-category brands or regional players that you didn't know were stealing your market share. Competitors are an output of AI behavior, not an input assumption.

### Unlocking the "Black Box": LLM Search Queries
Peec AI shows you which sources were cited.

**Genezio** goes a step further by revealing the **hidden fanout queries** the LLM generated to find those sources. LLMs translate user questions into internal search queries (e.g., "HubSpot vs Pipedrive pricing small business").

Genezio extracts these queries, allowing your SEO team to create content that answers the **exact** questions the AI is asking the web.

## Pricing and Philosophy

**Peec AI** is positioned as an affordable entry point. It is an excellent choice for teams with limited budgets who need basic visibility tracking without complex configuration.

**Genezio** is an enterprise-grade platform designed for brands and agencies who need to **win**. It offers {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/pricing/" >}}self-service onboarding with a free trial{{< /external-link >}}, but its architecture supports complex multi-tenant agency setups and deep forensic analysis of brand reputation.

## The Verdict

**Choose Peec AI if:**
* You are a small team just starting with AI visibility.
* You need a simple "pulse check" on a list of static prompts.
* Budget is your primary constraint.

**Choose Genezio if:**
* You need to understand **how specific buyer personas** perceive your brand.
* You want to optimize for **real user experiences** (Web interface) rather than API outputs.
* You need to discover **unknown competitors** automatically.
* You want actionable insights on **what content to build** based on actual LLM search behavior.

Genezio helps brands understand how AI talks about them and gives them the tools to influence what it says next.
