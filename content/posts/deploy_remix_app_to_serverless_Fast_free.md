If you donâ€™t have an existing Remix application, click {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/auth/signup?redirect=remix-getting-started" >}}here{{< /external-link >}} to get started.

**1. Install Genezio CLI:**

```bash
npm install genezio -g
```

**2. Create Configuration File:** In the root directory of your Remix application, run the following command to generate the necessary genezio.yaml configuration file.

```bash
genezio analyze
```

This command analyzes your project and creates a configuration file tailored to your application's needs.

**3. Deploy Your Application:** Execute the deployment command to upload your application to Genezio's serverless platform.

```bash

```

A browser window will open, prompting you to log in to your Genezio account and authorize the deployment.

```bash
genezio local
```

This command initiates a local server, allowing you to test your application in a development environment before deploying.
