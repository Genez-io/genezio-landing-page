Having the right software deployment tool can save companies {{< external-link link="https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper?hl=en" >}}millions of dollars{{< /external-link >}} . A whitepaper commissioned by Google even estimated that a company of 8,500 technical workers could save close to {{< external-link link="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/show-me-the-money-how-you-can-see-returns-up-to-259m-with-a-devops-transformation" >}}$10 million a year{{< /external-link >}} just because a good DevOps and deployment strategy would cut down their downtime. And that’s not counting the actual business gains that come from a good software deployment tool.

## Best software deployment tools

A good software deployment tool should allow developers to continuously update their code without breaking the central software. It should also make it easy to use from the first time on: a SaaS business should be able to deploy their software to a cloud or on-premises environment very quickly. And most importantly, it should be affordable or free, and ideally integrated with the cloud environment.

Using those standards, this article breaks down the 13 top deployment tools. You'll find tools that fit your needs and infrastructure, whether you're a solopreneur, a small team, or a large company.

## Genezio

{{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/" >}}Genezio{{< /external-link >}} is a serverless platform with an integrated software deployment tool. It stands out as a versatile typesafe — that you can’t program a typo — deployment tool that simplifies the process of deploying full-stack applications, whether for small projects, MVPs, or enterprise demos. It allows developers to focus on coding and launch faster with simple commands and a single codebase.

The Genezio CLI companion can be used to deploy your projects. You can run it on your machine or in your CI/CD (continuous integration and deployment) pipeline with {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/integrating-github-actions-with-genezio-for-ci/cd/" >}}GitHub actions{{< /external-link >}}.

Genezio is not just a deployment tool. The Genezio.Cloud feature automates the creation, testing, and deployment of {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/serverless-computing-when-to-go-serverless/" >}}serverless{{< /external-link >}} functions. Notably, {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/genezio-functions-reduce-cold-start-times-by-up-to-4x-compared-to-aws-lambda/#genezio-functions-vs-aws-lambda-vs-gcp-vs-vercel-vs-netlify" >}}Genezio Functions{{< /external-link >}} , a modern Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform, delivers up to four times faster cold start times than AWS Lambda, with a median cold start response time of around 54ms. It’s the kind of response time you might not consider important in a staging environment, but that could tilt the scale towards your own SaaS when a user realises it’s so quick. Former Amazon employees famously claimed almost 20 years ago that a {{< external-link link="https://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html" >}}100ms delay{{< /external-link >}} resulted in lost revenue.

Genezio automatically scales. It’s so quick to set up and it’s an ideal platform to deploy either an already-built app or to deploy microservices and start shaping up the app from there on.

**Key features:** It makes managing APIs easier by automatically creating an SDK. It has a framework-agnostic design that supports React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte. It’s compatible with tools like {{< external-link link="https://upstash.com/" >}}Upstash Redis{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://neon.tech/" >}}Neon Postgres{{< /external-link >}}.

### The distinction between CI and CD

Since we’ve introduced the concept, we’ll make clear what separates continuous integration with continuous deployment. CI is about making code ready for release — for example, testing — and CD is about actually releasing and deploying code. Both are automatic: CI automatically updates the code for testing, and CD automatically deploys a release for production. Software deployment tools usually follow this model because they mean to help developers introduce slight changes to a codebase without breaking the central program.

## Juju by Canonical

{{< external-link link="https://juju.is/" >}}Juju{{< /external-link >}} by Canonical is an open-source software deployment tool. It uses {{< external-link link="https://juju.is/docs/juju/model" >}}models{{< /external-link >}}, through which users define the final state of your application, and Juju takes care of provisioning the resources (e.g. a virtual machine) and configuring the software to achieve that state. Juju's unique feature is its use of {{< external-link link="https://juju.is/charms-architecture" >}}“charms”{{< /external-link >}} — reusable packages that automate every aspect of an application's life, from deployment to scaling and maintenance. Users say charms are still very resource-intensive.

Anything with the Canonical tag is very well-respected, and it deserves praise. But users are expressing concerns with Juju and its continuity. Some say that Juju was a project started before Kubernetes and orchestration frameworks were the norm. Since 2021, it has been rebranded as a framework to manage Kubernetes and virtual-machine workloads with one framework in mind. This implies that the next steps for Juju are not that clear.

**Key features:** Besides working well with major cloud providers, some users say it’s well-built for deploying on-premises hardware, particularly for {{< external-link link="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1dl1v6y/best_way_for_onprem_postgres/" >}}databases{{< /external-link >}}. It also scales applications on demand, and it integrates with {{< external-link link="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/" >}}Kubernetes{{< /external-link >}}. Since it’s from Canonical, users can also expect support with plenty of open-source Ops tools.

## AWS CodeDeploy

{{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/" >}}AWS CodeDeploy{{< /external-link >}} is Amazon’s entry for this list of software deployment tools. It automates software deployments to various AWS computing services, including EC2, Fargate (an {{< external-link link="https://optiowl.cloud/blog/why-fargate-is-still-too-costly" >}}expensive{{< /external-link >}} serverless option), and Lambda. It also supports on-premises servers and AWS infrastructure for a hybrid deployment strategy, but Amazon {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/pricing/" >}}imposes fees{{< /external-link >}} for using CodeDeploy on-premises. CodeDeploy is widespread and free as long as you’re using EC2 or other Amazon options. Considering Lambda still has up to four times slower cold start times compared to other entries on this list, those could be strong disadvantages.

As expected, Azure and Google Cloud Platform have their “own CodeDeploy” each, namely {{< external-link link="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service#features" >}}App Service{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://cloud.google.com/deploy?hl=en" >}}Cloud Deploy{{< /external-link >}} .

**Key features:** {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/product-integrations/?nc1=h_ls" >}}Integration{{< /external-link >}} with third-party tools like Chef, Puppet, and Jenkins, support for {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/aws-codedeploy-now-supports-linear-and-canary-deployments-for-amazon-ecs/" >}}canary deployments{{< /external-link >}} (in canary deployments, you roll out updates by taking just part of the traffic to the new deployment), and logs and monitoring through {{< external-link link="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html" >}}AWS CloudWatch{{< /external-link >}}.

## FluxCD

{{< external-link link="https://fluxcd.io/" >}}Flux CD{{< /external-link >}} is an open-source deployment and delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux and its tool {{< external-link link="https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger" >}}Flagger{{< /external-link >}} deploy apps with A/B rollouts. Flux can also handle Kubernetes resources, and how it handles resources different tasks are already set up. It’s a well-respected solution, but users report that its alert system is subpar, and it requires periodic checks to prevent issues. While it's a good fit for managing shared cluster components, service teams often prefer alternative tools, including {{< external-link link="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd" >}}Argo CD{{< /external-link >}}, which is a similar tool that can handle more clusters, according to users.

**Key features:** It's open-source, and it’s especially made for Kubernetes. But, according to their website, it’s far more versatile than that. Flux works with major container registries like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. It also works with OCI and other workflow providers.

## CircleCI

{{< external-link link="https://circleci.com/" >}}CircleCI{{< /external-link >}} is a continuous integration and deployment (a method through which developers can easily add incremental code) platform that helps automate the entire software development process because improving the codebase should not break the central components. It supports various programming languages, such as Ruby, Python, and Java. The tool is known for its flexibility — it offers customisable build environments and dashboards, integrates with AWS, {{< external-link link="https://www.heroku.com/" >}}Heroku{{< /external-link >}}, and Google Cloud, and includes features like {{< external-link link="https://circleci.com/docs/docker-layer-caching/" >}}Docker layer caching{{< /external-link >}} , parallel job execution, and {{< external-link link="https://circleci.com/docs/ssh-access-jobs/" >}}SSH debugging{{< /external-link >}}.

**Key features:** It offers flexible workflows defined using {{< external-link link="https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-yaml-a-beginner-s-guide/" >}}YAML files{{< /external-link >}}, and it automatically distributes tests (which should mean tests are carried out a {{< external-link link="https://gradle.com/gradle-enterprise-solutions/test-distribution/" >}}lot quicker{{< /external-link >}} than the average).

## Travis CI

{{< external-link link="https://www.travis-ci.com/" >}}Travis CI{{< /external-link >}} is an open-source CI/CD service — just like CircleCI — that automates testing and deployment for {{< external-link link="https://github.com/" >}}GitHub{{< /external-link >}} projects. It simplifies development with complete integration into GitHub and automatically detects new commits and builds branches or pull requests. Travis CI offers support for a range of platforms including {{< external-link link="https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/" >}}Linux{{< /external-link >}} , Mac, and iOS, and provides real-time test monitoring.

Key features: It offers {{< external-link link="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-matrix/" >}}Matrix Builds{{< /external-link >}} to test against multiple versions of languages, environments, and operating systems simultaneously. You can run {{< external-link link="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers#:~:text=Containers%20are%20technologies%20that%20allow,the%20files%20necessary%20to%20run." >}}containers{{< /external-link >}} with it. After successful builds, they can be automatically sent to cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud.

## Jenkins

{{< external-link link="https://www.jenkins.io/" >}}Jenkins{{< /external-link >}} is a well-known open-source automation and software deployment tool with a big (almost 2000) {{< external-link link="https://plugins.jenkins.io/" >}}plugin ecosystem{{< /external-link >}}. Also, its support for distributed builds across multiple machines speeds up deployment tasks. Jenkins’ user-friendly web interface makes setup simple and error-handling also simple.

**Key features:** It has large plugin support for diverse use cases. It supports distributed builds for large projects.

## Bamboo

{{< external-link link="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo" >}}Bamboo{{< /external-link >}} by Atlassian is yet another CI/CD tool that automates the software deployment process. It easily integrates with other Atlassian products like {{< external-link link="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/integrate-with-bamboo/" >}}Jira{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bitbucket-cloud-289277000.html" >}}Bitbucket{{< /external-link >}}. Bamboo automates builds, testing, and deployment while providing full visibility into code changes and issues. It offers language-agnostic support and has a reasonable {{< external-link link="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bamboo-questions/CI-pipeline-in-Bamboo-for-iOS-and-Android-on-a-common-server/qaq-p/696817" >}}pipeline{{< /external-link >}} for continuously developing apps on Google Play Store or Apple Store.

## PDQ Deploy

{{< external-link link="https://www.pdq.com/pdq-deploy/" >}}PDQ Deploy{{< /external-link >}} can help deploy a custom SaaS solution or a script alike, but it’s better known in the IT world because it simplifies rolling out updates on Windows systems. It allows for custom installation settings and updates across multiple computers simultaneously. Its real-time status monitoring keeps IT administrators informed about deployment activity, even during a {{< external-link link="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wnrxqlewo" >}}security update{{< /external-link >}}.

**Key features:** Integration with {{< external-link link="https://help.pdq.com/hc/en-us/articles/220535907-How-to-Synchronize-Active-Directory-with-PDQ-Inventory" >}}Active Directory{{< /external-link >}} for targeted deployments, and detailed reporting on installations. **Bonus:** PDQ Deploy is {{< external-link link="https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/agentless-monitoring" >}}agentless{{< /external-link >}}, which means developers don't need to install software on target machines before using it (although {{< external-link link="https://versionsof.net/framework/" >}}.NET 4.6{{< /external-link >}} or higher is recommended for full feature support). It uses a client–server model instead.

## Microsoft Intune

No, {{< external-link link="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune" >}}Microsoft Intune{{< /external-link >}} will not help you if you need to deploy your custom SaaS code. But it’s mentioned by plenty of sysadmin workers who need to roll out features on devices, and as such we’re mentioning it as a good “deployment” tool. Intune companies to manage deployments (Win32, MS Store apps) from a central location for various devices. Since it integrates with the Microsoft Store, companies can deploy new UWP apps without needing to download, package, or script installations.

**Key features:** It manages mobile and desktop devices, including deployment and updates.
