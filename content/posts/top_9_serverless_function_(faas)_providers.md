Startups choose serverless or FaaS because it’s affordable, it’s easy to set up, and it scales. Yet, unfortunately, choosing the wrong serverless provider can be expensive and nerve-wracking. For example, a company {{< external-link link="https://insights.project-a.com/we-cut-our-aws-bill-by-65-after-moving-to-lambda-part-2-heres-how-we-did-it/" >}}slashed its AWS bill{{< /external-link >}} from around $2,200 to $773 per month by switching from AWS Fargate — AWS’s serverless solution — to a FaaS module.

Serverless solutions like Fargate work well for complex applications that require long-running processes, but for short-lived functions or simpler applications, FaaS platforms can be more convenient, and can be even more affordable than the almost $800/month platform we referred to.

This article focuses on the top FaaS providers, many of which also offer serverless platforms. Plenty of providers highlight the same benefits — scalability and pay-per-use — but some functions alternatives are considerably more affordable, easier to use, and with better cold start times. You'll find serverless computing providers who fit your business and technology needs, whether you're a solopreneur, a small DevOps team, or a big company.

## What is a FaaS provider?

A FaaS provider is a vendor offering a Function-as-a-Service computing service that allows developers to run individual functions — units of code that perform specific tasks — without managing servers or infrastructure.

FaaS belongs to the serverless model of cloud computing. On FaaS, the provider handles resource allocation and scaling automatically based on demand. This model is ideal for applications with unpredictable workloads or in early development stages, as it supports scalable and affordable solutions for event-driven tasks and microservices architectures. It’s also an excellent alternative to the usual monolithic app model. With the right FaaS providers, developers can add features to a full-stack webapp without compromising the main codebase.

## The best FaaS providers for developers and companies

Discover the top 9 serverless function (FaaS) providers available today. Each platform offers specific features and integrations, designed for full-stack developers and MVPs alike:

## Genezio

{{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/docs/#:~:text=Genezio%20Functions%E2%80%8B,to%20events%20without%20managing%20servers." >}}Genezio Functions{{< /external-link >}} is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) solution that streamlines the deployment and management of full-stack applications. As a FaaS platform, Genezio eliminates the need for developers to manage servers, and allows them to focus instead on writing and deploying code. This makes it a {{< external-link link="https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio" >}}reliable choice{{< /external-link >}} for small projects, MVPs, and enterprise demos. Genezio’s type safe backend delivers a simple and secure application development experience, while automatic SDK generation gives developers a simple frontend-backend integration.

The platform’s Genezio.Cloud module automates the development, testing, and deployment of serverless functions, and provides up to {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/genezio-functions-reduce-cold-start-times-by-up-to-4x-compared-to-aws-lambda/" >}}four times faster{{< /external-link >}} cold start times than AWS Lambda, with a median cold start response time of around 54ms.

Genezio is framework-agnostic, which means it supports popular stacks like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte. It integrates easily with tools like {{< external-link link="https://upstash.com/" >}}Upstash Redis{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://neon.tech/" >}}Neon Postgres{{< /external-link >}}, and offers in this way flexible database management. The platform stands out for having {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/what-is-type-safety/">}}typesafe{{< /external-link >}} environment. Type safety means that the compiler will verify types during compilation and report an error if an incorrect type is assigned to a variable. It also gets mentioned for its ease of use and great cold start times.

### Which FaaS providers are the quickest to set up?

Genezio is also remarkably easy to use—and quick to get started with. Developers can deploy a “Hello World” function in under two minutes after signing up, and then edit it directly in the browser. Some developers have already deployed a slightly more complex full-stack webapp {{< external-link link="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laurentiu-ciobanu_running-rust-on-genezio-you-heard-me-right-activity-7142892752794546176-TTa5/">}}in three minutes{{< /external-link >}}.

Genezio features AWS Lambda compatibility. This means that developers can migrate {{< external-link link="https://genezio.com/blog/what-is-function-as-a-service/#disadvantages-of-function-as-a-service-faas">}}functions{{< /external-link >}} to Genezio without any code changes—and with considerably better cold-start times and more predicable costs.

Below, you can see two ways to get started: {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/import">}}importing a project{{< /external-link >}} directly from GitHub or starting with a {{< external-link link="https://app.genez.io/fork?repository=https://github.com/Genez-io/faas-getting-started">}}“Hello World” function template:{{< /external-link >}}

## AWS

AWS offers serverless with {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">}}Fargate{{< /external-link >}} and functions with {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">}}AWS Lambda{{< /external-link >}}, a FaaS platform designed for event-driven applications. It integrates well with other AWS services, so it is a safe choice for developers already using AWS. Lambda supports several languages, including Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, and .NET Core. It also allows for custom runtimes and arbitrary executables.

As a FaaS offering, pricing is based on usage, with charges for the number of requests and the duration of function executions. Developers can choose provisioned concurrency to reduce cold start delays, or use {{< external-link link="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html">}}Lambda@Edge{{< /external-link >}} for edge deployments. Lambda integrates with Amazon’s {{< external-link link="https://aws.amazon.com/es/rds/proxy/">}}RDS Proxy{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html">}}Elastic File System{{< /external-link >}} to connect to databases and manage file storage.

Lambda can automatically adjust to different tasks. It takes care of server and OS maintenance, and facilitates function management and troubleshooting.

## Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform offers functions with the aptly-named {{< external-link link="https://cloud.google.com/functions?hl=es_419">}}Google Cloud Functions{{< /external-link >}}, a commonly used serverless FaaS platform designed for running code in response to events without server management.

This is an affordable FaaS solution and pricing, like most FaaS offerings, is pay-per-use: the first two million requests are free, and additional requests are priced at $0.40 per million. This is identical to what other big providers charge, but users report other costs — e.g. in computing power — stack up so quickly that it’s sometimes more convenient to recur to a niche player or to use an architecture other than functions-based. The platform’s 2nd gen release integrates easily with 18 Google Cloud services like {{< external-link link="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview">}}Cloud Pub/Sub{{< /external-link >}} and {{< external-link link="https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions">}}Firebase{{< /external-link >}}, as well as third-party services.
