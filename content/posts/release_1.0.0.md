Big news: Genezio has just hit V1.0! It's a major milestone that shows just how far we’ve come. This version is packed with updates to simplify and improve how you build and manage your projects. From streamlined error messaging and an improved configuration file, to easier project testing and improved authentication, V1.0 is designed to accelerate your development speed and scalability.

## Enhanced CLI Error Output

Error handling in the CLI has been vastly improved. With clearer messages and guidance, troubleshooting is now more straightforward, helping you solve issues quickly and keep your development on track.

## Big Changes for Easier Setup

This isn't just an update; it's a complete transformation designed to enhance configuration management, making it more powerful and flexible.

We are introducing a new format for the `.yaml` configuration file to simplify configuring your next deployments. Curious about the specs?

## Test Your Projects Easily

Testing is an integral part of the development process, and with Genezio V1.0, it's getting easier. Now, you can test your project locally using the Test interface on the Genezio Dashboard.

## User Authentication Improvements

We’ve made some improvements to our built-in authentication module. It’s more straightforward and secure, whether you’re working with databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB. This means less time worrying about user logins and more time creating great features.

## What’s next?

Genezio V1.0 is all about making things easier for you, from fixing bugs to adding new parts to your projects. We’re here to help you save time and build better web applications.
