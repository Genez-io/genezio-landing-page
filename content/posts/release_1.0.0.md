Big news: Genezio has just hit V1.0! It's a major milestone that shows how far we’ve come.

With Genezio V1.0, you can be confident that Genezio is not only more stable but also fully prepared for production-ready projects designed to scale. This version ensures you can prototype quickly with Genezio and scale effortlessly as your project expands.

From easier project testing and improved authentication, to streamlined error messaging and an improved configuration file, V1.0 is designed to accelerate your development speed and scalability.

## User Authentication Improvements

We’ve made some improvements to our built-in authentication module. It’s more straightforward and secure, whether you’re working with databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB. This means less time worrying about user logins and more time creating great features.

## Test Your Projects Easily

Testing is an integral part of the development process, and with Genezio V1.0, it's getting easier. Now, you can test your project locally using the Test interface on the Genezio Dashboard.

## Enhanced CLI Error Output

Error handling in the CLI has been vastly improved. With clearer messages and guidance, troubleshooting is now more straightforward, helping you solve issues quickly and keep your development on track.

## Big Changes for Easier Setup

This isn't just an update; it's a complete transformation designed to enhance configuration management, making it more powerful and flexible.

We are introducing a new format for the `.yaml` configuration file to simplify configuring your next deployments, but don’t worry, we’ll update existing projects semi-automatically. Curious about the changes?

## What’s next?

Genezio V1.0 is all about making things easier for you, from fixing bugs to adding new parts to your projects. We’re here to help you save time and build better web applications.
