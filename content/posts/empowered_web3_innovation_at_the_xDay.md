This article will present DeFiBuilder and GiveCup, two emerging Web3 startups that started their journey at the xDay.2023 Hackathon, one of Europe’s largest Web3 developers competitions.

Teams from both DeFiBuilder and GiveCup won big prizes at the hackathon, and we are very excited to tell you that genezio helped them save a lot of time during the hackathon. The winning teams said genezio enabled them to focus on developing their features, rather than spend time on configuring servers and settings.

## What is Web3?

Web3 is a new and emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize many industries and solve some of the most pressing problems of our time. For example, Web3 could be used to create a more equitable and inclusive financial system or to develop new and innovative solutions to global needs.

One of the challenges of developing successful Web3 applications, also known as dApps, is ensuring that they are easily accessible for any user. dApps should be easy to use even for users that do not have in-depth knowledge on Web3 technologies. To achieve that, a Web3 application should provide a friendly Web2 interface - either a website or a mobile app.

Assuming it’s a website, especially at a hackathon, the developer needs to have an easy way to deploy both the frontend and the backend. Some simple dApps only have a frontend written in React, Angular, Vue.js or any other frontend framework that calls directly APIs to access the blockchain. In this case, genezio helps with deploying the frontend on AWS with CDN.

However, sophisticated dApps have separate backend code that needs to be deployed and managed separately. The backend code is hidden from the user and makes a better place to put your API keys. Deploying the backend requires advanced cloud experience. This is where genezio steps in offering one command deploy. The backend can also use databases like Radis and PostgreSQL.

DeFiBuilder and GiveCup took the challenge to build tools that are easy to use and help their users interact with the Web3 ecosystem. Let’s talk about their solutions and how they integrated genezio in their development process.

## DeFiBuilder

DeFiBuilder is a No-Code dApp Builder that helps developers speed up the development of DeFi Apps. It provides a variety of pre-built modules that can be used to create custom tokens, DEXs, yield farms, and more.

For the xDay.2023 Hackathon, the team ported one of their modules to the MultiversX blockchain. This new module, called xDeFi GPT, allows users to easily create token contracts with a few clicks and an easy prompt given to a trained AI model.

To deploy the frontend of their application the DeFiBuilder team used genezio. This allowed them to focus on developing their core features without having to worry about the complexities of deployment.

To get the most out of it, they are planning to move their backend from EC2 AWS to genezio.

## GiveCup

GiveCup is a mobile app that revolutionizes the way charitable donations are made. It integrates the benefits of blockchain, gamification, and community-building to ensure that every donation counts while providing a rewarding and engaging user experience.

The GiveCup team used genezio to deploy both the backend and frontend of their application. For the backend, they integrated genezio with the Multiverse SDK to query the blockchain.

## Benefits of using genezio for Web3 projects

After discussing with the winners from the xDay.2023 hackathon, we found out that these were the greatest genezio benefits for them during the hackathon:

- **One-command deployment:** Genezio makes it easy to deploy your Web3 application with a single command, hiding the complexities of configuring and managing servers on AWS, saving precious time for development of the core features.
- **Full-stack examples:** Genezio provides many examples that you can use as a starting point for your own dApp. This can save you a lot of time and effort in development. Check out this example of a cool full-stack Admin Dashboard on the genezio repository: {{< external-link link="https://github.com/creativetimofficial/black-dashboard-genezio" >}}https://github.com/creativetimofficial/black-dashboard-genezio{{< /external-link >}}
- **Out-of-the-box scalability:** Genezio is designed to scale to meet the needs of even the most demanding applications. This makes it a good choice for Web3 developers who are building dApps that are expected to experience high levels of traffic and usage.
