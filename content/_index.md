productTextP2: "Because you like writing elegant code. You donâ€™t want to lose time 
configuring backend servers, writing cumbersome GET URLs, 
you want your code to just run. And you want to write the backend 
code in your favorite language - be it Swift, Kotlin, etc."

power consumption, and we are optimizing the way the code is run towards our goal of zero overhead, fastest cold start delay, best CPU and memory resource allocation."
