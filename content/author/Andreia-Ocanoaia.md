description: "Andreia Ocanoaia is a software engineer who loves building tools that make developers’ lives easier. At Genezio, she focuses on backend development, cloud solutions, and making sure everything runs smoothly under the hood. She’s always looking for ways to write cleaner, more efficient code and help others do the same.

Beyond coding, Andreia is passionate about teaching and mentoring. She’s a Teaching Assistant at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, where she helps students navigate topics like operating systems, cloud computing, and memory management. She’s also active in the open-source community, regularly sharing knowledge on GitHub, Medium, and through workshops. When she’s not deep in code, you’ll probably find her speaking at tech events or experimenting with new technologies."
